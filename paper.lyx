\begin_layout Abstract
This paper considers factors during the peace process that contribute to
 the success or failure of peace talks, and, of ultimately peace agreements.
 The FARC-Colombia talks from 2012-2016 sought to end an intractable half-centur
y-long conflict with a negotiated settlement.
 Using a new dataset of separate statements from the government and FARC
 (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) and joint statements from
 the negotiators, I use sentiment analysis and hidden Markov models to estimate
 each actor's willingness to negotiate as a function of their textual sentiment.
 I find that estimates of FARC's and the government's willingness to negotiate
 can predict the sentiment of joint statements.
 I use a Markov process to estimate sentiment responsiveness, and, contrary
 to my predictions, I find that actors are unlikely to respond to each other
 with the same levels of sentiment.
 These results suggest that using sentiment analysis to measure the progress
 of peace talks is a promising new tool for research on why talks are successful
 or derailed by violence and, ultimately, what makes some peace agreements
 durable.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do some peace negotiations succeed while others fall apart, and what
 accounts for the durability of peace after some conflicts but not others?
 Understanding the factors behind successful conflict termination is of
 great academic and real-world importance.
 Much of the existing analysis of peace processes and outcomes has tended
 to use game theoretical or case specific approaches, and empirical research
 has focused on violence during negotiations and implementation of agreements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, many scholars have modelled peace negotiations, for either
 interstate or intrastate wars, as a bargaining process or game 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "powell2002bargaining,fey2011uncertainty,pillar2014negotiating"

\end_inset

.
 Building upon these themes, a major strand in the theoretical literature
 explains peace process failure as a commitment problem driven by uncertainty.
 Beliefs about guarantees for implementing agreements determine whether
 combatants choose to resume fighting or commit to peace 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "walter2002committing"

\end_inset

.
 Accordingly, postconflict research has examined the effect of peacekeeping
 operations and other third-party guarantees intended to resolve the commitment
 problem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fortna2004does,fortna2008does"

\end_inset

.
 Looking at transitions to peace more generally, scholars have used hand-coded
 texts of peace agreements to better understand whether provisions such
 as political representation for rebels in postconflict governments or territori
al autonomy predict peace survival 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hartzell2001stabilizing"

\end_inset

.
 Other empirical and theoretical work has examined postconflict institutions
 such as power-sharing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding ongoing negotiations, researchers have posited theories to explain
 the variable effect of violent attacks on derailing talks

\end_inset

 and the relationship between government concessions and the level of terrorist
 activity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Often these accounts are driven by an information asymmetry about whether
 actors are sincere.
 Other research has looked for peace process spoilers within the cacophony
 of factions in state and nonstate actors, with some scholars arguing that
 internal contestation and excluded or disgruntled parties can thwart peace
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, more recent findings suggest that including all factions is less
 important than originally thought

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, a broad body of empirical and theoretical literature has discussed
 many features of peace negotiations and their outcomes.
 However, to my knowledge there is no empirical research that estimates
 the status of peace talks over time---e.g whether they are deadlocked, near
 an agreement, or about to fall apart.
 Understanding the negotiations process is a key to explaining the dynamics
 of bargaining, the provisions that end up in agreements, and whether these
 settlements bring about peace.
 But no existing research analyzes texts issued from peace negotiations
 other than the final agreement itself, nor has sentiment analysis previously
 been used to study peace processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fill this gap, this paper makes several original contributions.
 I collect a new dataset of texts from the Colombian government and FARC,
 in addition to joint statements issued by the peace negotiators, from an
 ongoing conflict/negotiation period (2012-2016).
 I use text analysis methods from psychology and natural language processing
 to measure the sentiment of these documents.
 Although it is difficult to draw causal conclusions from this kind of observati
onal data, these texts are a promising and heretofore unutilized source
 of information about the state of negotiations.
 I use the textual sentiment in hidden Markov models to estimate each actor's
 willingness to negotiate.
 To validate the model's results, I predict the sentiment and issuance of
 joint statements using the estimates of willingness.
 These findings offer potential explanations to questions such as why negotiatio
ns continue despite episodes of violence, and how the sentiment of each
 actor's statements affects the output from the peace negotiators---and
 perhaps ultimately, the peace treaty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I use sentiment analysis and Markov processes to model the responsiveness
 of sentiment---e.g.
 whether FARC is more likely to respond to a positive government statement
 with a positive statement of its own rather than a negative one, in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 strategy---and whether sentiment is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sticky.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Results about the persistence of sentiment may help explain the effect
 of shocks such as extremist attacks, while the findings about responsiveness
 can yield insights about the mechanics of the negotiations or about public
 statements as a form of signalling.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) was founded in 1964, in the
 aftermath of the ten-year period of civil war known as La Violencia.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The group's rarely used, official name is Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
 de Colombia--Ejército del Pueblo (People's Army), or FARC-EP.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Originally a Marxist insurgency seeking to overthrow the government, FARC's
 supporters were mainly communists and rural peasants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 FARC's current circumstances can be traced to the 1980s and 1990s, when
 it began to tax cocaine producers, soon becoming involved in cocaine production
 itself 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wilson-center"

\end_inset

.
 This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups, such as the
 Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia),
 who battled FARC about, inter alia, control over drug trafficking 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wilson-center"

\end_inset

.
 FARC's tactics have included murder, kidnappings for ransom, disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion; less widely known abroad
 is their use of landmines, which have killed or maimed thousands, and their
 kidnapping and forced conscription of child soldiers.
 The paramilitaries used many of the same tactics; AUC was also labelled
 a terrorist organization and was also involved in drug trafficking prior
 to being disbanded in the mid-2000s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "colombiareports-auc"

\end_inset

 FARC, the paramilitaries, and the government have all been accused of human
 rights abuses in the violence, which has claimed the lives of more than
 200,000 civilians and displaced millions

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has much the same history as FARC: it was founded
 around the same time and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, extortion,
 and other violence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the government
 as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several years.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 During the '80s, FARC also co-founded a political party, the Patriotic
 Union, which had declined into nonexistence by the '90s after thousands
 of its members, politicians, and candidates were murdered

During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, significant
ly reducing the strength of FARC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CFR"

\end_inset

.
 FARC's willingness to negotiate is generally attributed in part to this
 crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, commenced in the fall of 2012
 in Havana and have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos.
 The talks were limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 Over the course of the peace process, negotiators came to preliminary agreement
s for these topics, which will be included in the final peace deal.
 Despite this progress, Santos's approval ratings have plummeted since he
 took office, because of public skepticism/pessimism and the vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe and some members of
 the military that oppose provisions which, in their view, give the former
 rebels political representation and amnesty instead of prosecution for
 crimes committed

With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Their negotiating team, led by the rebel alias Ivan Marquez, is comprised
 of numerous Secretariat members and has included top members from key Fronts
 (regional subdivisions).
 Despite this high-ranking participation and FARC's declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the killings of rural policemen to
 the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC released statements on their
 website and created an additional website about the peace process, which
 features blogs of individual negotiators.

 To take FARC-Colombia as our example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is significant to the government because of the political cost of continuing
 to negotiate and the still heavier cost of a failure (prior to the announcement

), and because of uncertainty about whether avowedly Marxist-Leninist revolution
aries who have not disarmed are serious about a deal that will stipulate
 disarmament but not a Marxist-Leninist political-economic system.
 To this end, the Santos government held out on the bilateral ceasefire,
 arguably FARC's most coveted concession, until just weeks before the final
 deal was reached.

\begin_layout Standard
As the threat of a return to violence casts a long shadow over negotiations,
 unsurprisingly the focus of much empirical research is on violence during
 the peace process.
 For instance, Kydd and Walter argue that extremist violence during peace
 negotiations reveals information about the rebel group's inability or unwilling
ness to control extremist factions, and derails talks if trust is low 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kydd-walter"

\end_inset

.
 A basic premise underlying this theory is that the government cannot discern
 whether the rebels are sincere based on their words alone.
 (Similar reasoning underlies one rationalist explanation for war, which
 is based on the incentives of both parties to misrepresent their resolve
 to go to war and their military power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fearon"

\end_inset

.) Yet the FARC-Colombia negotiations ran concurrently with violence, as
 is often the case, but neither regular low-intensity violence nor shocks
 permanently derailed the FARC talks (although they were temporarily suspended
 several times).

 Other empirical research on postconflict transitions has found that peace

 agreement provisions such as territorial autonomy and assurances of security

 Much as we might look at the draft bills and amendments that precede a
 piece of final legislation, we should look at the output from negotiations
 processes if we want to understand what causes the outcomes of durable
 peace or failed negotiations.

 This method is novel in that it uses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

talk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than actions or violence; the results would be most useful if they
 predict documents issued from the negotiating table, although unfortunately
 this does not include the final peace agreement.
 I hypothesize that greater willingness to negotiate is positively associated
 with (1) positive joint statements and (2) issuance of joint statements.
\begin_inset Foot

Since joint statements can announce agreements on policy, progress reports,
 or the next steps in the negotiating schedule, their occurrence may be
 a rough metric for how much is being accomplished.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In other words, when FARC and/or the government are estimated to be in
 conciliatory rather than hardline states, I predict that joint statements
 are more likely to occur and that their positive sentiment is higher and
 negative sentiment is lower.
 I validate the HMM results by testing these hypotheses with regressions.

 using another Markov process.
 Drawing broadly from research on responsiveness in negotiations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, I hypothesize that an actor is more likely to respond with the same level
 of sentiment as the most recent statement from the other actor.
 In other words, if FARC issues a statement with high (positive) sentiment,
 the following government statement is more likely to respond with high
 rather than low (negative) sentiment, and vice versa.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper uses an original dataset of (1) communiqués issued by FARC, (2)
 statements of the Colombian government, and (3) joint communiqués issued
 by the peace negotiators.
 The statements in the original Spanish were scraped and parsed in Python,
 thus avoiding the pitfalls of inter-translator variance, loss of nuance
 through translation, etc.
 The data was collected from September 1, 2012, the month in which formal
 peace talks were announced, through May 31, 2016, the beginning of this
 project.
 Unfortunately, this excludes the weeks leading up to the announcement of
 a final agreement in August 2016.

 the dictionary is not tailored for political science purposes; and their

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling hidden states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task is to use the shares of positive and negative
 sentiment in a sequence of texts to model a Markov regime-switching model,
 in which the hidden regimes are discrete states that represent whether
 government or FARC is in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state.
 In other words, we are interested in the random variable that represents
 FARC's (or the government's) willingness to negotiate, which is directly
 unobservable.
 Instead, we observe the stream of positive and negative sentiment of the
 FARC documents, which emanate from the latent state that FARC is in at
 the time.
 To simplify this discussion, I assume a state space with two possible states,
 but the model can theoretically be generalized to any number of states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This regime-switching or hidden Markov model (HMM) is a special case of
 a first-order Markov process.
 The sequence of states is a Markov chain: the probabilities of being in
 a hardline or conciliatory state, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

, respectively, exhibit the Markov property, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr(S_{t}=S_{H})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr(S_{t}=S_{C})$
\end_inset

 depends only on the realization of the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the realization of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 captures all information about what occurred prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 I assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is in a hidden state and we observe the emissions, or symbols,
 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{t}$
\end_inset

 from time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of an observed emission 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Thus, we can compute the probability of a stream of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1},...,O_{T}$
\end_inset

 by using a shortcut called the forward-backward algorithmn to sum over
 all of the hidden state sequences that could have generated that stream
 of observations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "rabiner1989tutorial"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of loessed
 sentiment measures: the percent of negative emotion words in FARC statements
 might look like 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimizing the number of states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discussion has used a discrete state space with two possible states.
 In some cases substantive/theoretical grounds may define an appropriate
 number of latent states for a HMM; however, because the spectrum from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can reasonably be split into different numbers of states, I adopt an agnostic
 approach.
 The number of states in the best-fitting HMM can be identified by the Bayesian
 information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
 values.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other applications of hidden Markov models, the number of states is not
 mathematically optimized because it and the labels attached to the states
 tend to determined by substantive criteria: e.g.
 in medical examples, values for various indicators of health that fall
 within certain ranges correspond to pre-set states, and in economic examples,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 markets are modelled with two states that clearly correspond with economic
 indicators.
 This paper uses a more agnostic approach.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To keep interpretation across the FARC and government models comparable,
 I specify the same number of latent states.
 Although the substantive interpretation of the model accommodates small
 numbers of latent states--for instance, two latent states would correspond
 to a dichotomy between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while three latent states might represent low, moderate, and high levels
 of willingness to negotiate, representing hardline, moderate and conciliatory
 regimes, respectively--as the number of states increases, the substantive
 interpretation of transition probabilities across these states becomes
 more challenging, and fitting the model becomes difficult because transitions
 between any two given states may be rare or nonexistent.
 I weigh these considerations against the models' log-likelihood, BIC, and
 AIC values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Labelling the states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because HMM estimation does not attach substantive labels to the states,
 such labelling must be done post-estimation.
 I explore two possible methods.
 First, I rank the unlabelled states in order of willingness to negotiate
 based on mean emotion.
 For example, the state with the highest positive emotion and lowest negative
 emotion would correspond to high willingness (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), while the state with the lowest positive emotion and the highest negative
 emotion should be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 I also use a multi-choice decision matrix to optimize the ranking of states
 based on mean sentiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling sentiment responsiveness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper uses a Markov process to model how sentiment
 responds to sentiment.
 I assume that the sequence of time-ordered statements represents a single
 Markov process, like a back-and-forth debate in which each text responds
 to the document that immediately preceded it.
 The irregularity of the data presents some challenges, as there are stretches
 in the time-ordered sequence of FARC and government texts where little
 alternation occurs.
 This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly three
 times as many statements from the government as from FARC and that both
 actors sometimes release multiple statements on the same day.
 This means that a FARC document could respond to a previous FARC document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To categorize overall sentiment of these texts as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I constructed an indicator defined by LIWC-based research that found that
 in normal usage, positive emotion words occur twice as frequently as negative
 emotion words 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pennebaker-chung"

\end_inset

.
 The indicator takes on the value 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the loessed proportion of positive words in a statement is at least
 twice the loessed proportion of negative words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 I used this indicator to construct a categorical variable representing
 the four possible states: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC/low,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC/high,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

As before, the probabilities of transitioning from state to state are represente
d in a Markov transition matrix.
 I estimate the transition probabilities using a multinomial logit with
 maximum likelihood estimation.

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing Model (1) vs.
 (2) and Model (3) vs.
 (4) shows that the inclusion of violence and public opinion covariates
 does little to improve fit.
 Going from 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2,$
\end_inset

 the improvement in BIC and AIC values demonstrates that a mixture is a
 better fit for the data than a single state.
 However, for the FARC models with and without covariates, the BIC values
 suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 optimizes the number of latent states; although 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 has a slightly better BIC value than 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 in both models, the improvement is marginal and is weighed against the
 consideration that the fewest possible number of latent states should be
 used.
 Similarly, although the AIC values across the board favor a specification
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=5$
\end_inset

, these improvements in fit must be balanced against the tradeoff in the
 interpretability of results (e.g.
 what is the substantive meaning of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transition from 1/5 to 2/5 hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?) and the difficulty of substantively labelling a large number of states.
 Consequently, the following analysis will proceed with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 latent states, without the covariates.

\begin_layout Standard
What do the transition probabilities reveal about the persistence of willingness
 to negotiate? Hardline or moderate states for FARC have very high rates
 of stickiness.
 For the government, on the other hand, the transition probabilities in
 each row are more evenly dispersed.
 These probabilities suggest that if FARC experiences a shock that causes
 negative sentiment, it will be difficult to transition out of that state,
 while the government's sentiment is both more resilient and more volatile
 because it can transition from any state to any state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can further examine these results in light of the line graphs below,
 which show the estimated states of FARC and the government over the time
 period of the negotiations.
 Although FARC is predicted to never transition directly from low to high
 and vice versa, and to never transition from moderate to low, these transitions
 do occur, perhaps because of rounding.
 Interestingly, although both FARC and the government have a fairly high
 probabilities of transitioning to moderate willingness from any state,
 each spends very little time in the moderate state.
 This suggests that a model with two latent states might actually have been
 preferable for ease of interpretation.

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the government's willingness to negotiate is more volatile, with
 frequent regime switching from low to high throughout the time interval.
 The irregularity and frequency of data accounts for some of this volatility:
 statements may be issued days or months apart, and there are three times
 as many government documents.
 Nevertheless, the government's lower probabilities of state persistence
 are consistent with the volatility of transitions.
 A potential explanation is that the government must address many different
 audiences: toward FARC, the government must be a tough negotiator; for
 domestic critics, the government must appease hawks' objections about specific
 provisions such as seats in the legislature for ex-guerrillas or amnesty
 from prosecution; for the military, the government must reassure them about
 concerns regarding potential prosecution of military personnel for acts
 committed during the war; for the international community, the government
 pledges its commitment to peace as it possibly seeks regional or UN assistance
 with implementation; and for the public, the government must assure survivors
 that the voices of victims of the conflict have been heard, and encourage
 optimism so that people will vote for the deal in the referendum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, regardless of the “truth” about FARC's seriousness or willingness,
 popular impressions (e.g.
 “FARC is stalling” or “the government isn't driving a hard enough bargain”)
 affect the government's bargaining behavior and demands in public and in
 private, its level of military operations, and certainly its rhetoric.
 The government has to answer to public opinion, political opponents and,
 eventually, the next cycle of elections; thus, the political toll of failing
 to address one of its constituencies is very high.
 FARC, on the other hand, has fewer audiences and interests to address:
 its rank and file fighters who need to be persuaded to demobilize; its
 bargaining adversary, the government; and occasionally the nation.
 Unlike the government, FARC's decision to negotiate is not being constantly
 and publicly questioned, and it does not face leadership challenges.
 Thus, FARC has fewer disparate constituencies and is arguably less motivated
 to address them.

Validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HMM results are most useful if they can predict the content of output
 from the joint negotiations, such as (but not in this case) the final ageement.
 To evaluate this, I regress joint statement sentiment on the estimated
 FARC/government willingness on the day that the statement was issued, with
 linear interaction terms, to test hypothesis (1) that both actors' willingness
 to negotiate is positively associated with positive sentiment of joint
 statements and negatively associated with negative sentiment.
 I use a logistic regression to test hypothesis (2) that high willingness
 to negotiate is positively associated with the issuance of joint statements.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding hypothesis (1), the interaction terms show that the effect of
 each actor's willingness depends on the other actor's willingness.
 When the government is hardline and FARC is either conciliatory/hardline,
 this is associated with much lower levels of positive sentiment and slightly
 lower levels of negative sentiment, relative to the moderate willingness
 state.
 The statistical power of these results is hampered by the small number
 of joint statements, and we are unable to draw the same conclusions about
 FARC.
 In short, there is partial support for hypothesis (1), insofar as low governmen
t willingness to negotiate is associated with less positive joint statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether the states estimated by the HMM can predict joint statement
 issuance, I created date/state indicator variables for FARC and the government
 for each day in the negotiations period, and a dummy variable for joint
 statement issuance.
 I use a logistic regression with linear interaction terms.
 However, none of the results are statistically significant, and hypothesis
 (2) is not find supported.
 (Table in Appendix.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is there not clear support for these hypotheses? One possibility is
 that there is a lag between a period of willingness that produces some
 progress, and the joint announcement/action that we are trying to observe.
 Another is that sentiment of joint statements is not the best metric for
 progress in talks, and that high levels of emotional language may result
 from discussions about the topic of victims and survivors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we may also consider willingness in the context of major events,
 in order to discuss the theory that high trust prevents talks from being
 derailed

 Beginning in June 2015, FARC launched a series of attacks, bombing infrastructu
re such as oil pipelines in Norte de Santander, Putumayo, and Nariño, resulting
 in an oil spill that caused severe environmental damage and contaminated
 the water supply of thousands; and bombing power stations that supplied
 electricity to the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco

\end_inset

.
 This time period coincides with an episode of volatile regime-switching
 for the government, but it coincides with a period of high FARC willingness
 to negotiate.
 Although bombings and conciliatory sentiment seem contradictory, the conciliato
ry sentiments in FARC's statements during this period may explain why peace
 talks continued despite the attacks.
 Hardline sentiment backed by violent attacks might have signalled FARC's
 readiness to walk away from the negotiations, but conciliatory sentiment
 might have contributed to the eventual resumption of talks.

Although threatening to suspend or suspending talks (

 threat very rarely during these negotiations: in fact, only on these two

 FARC suspended talks on one occasion in 2013, over objections about the
 government's plan to hold a referendum

 This episode, too, falls within FARC's long spell of

 willingness to negotiate; as with the bombings, FARC's conciliatory sentiment
 (combined with the safe return of the general) may help explain why the
 peace talks recovered from this crisis.
 Although these examples are purely anecdotal, they are generally consistent
 with the concepts of willingness or seriousness.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sentiment responsiveness results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of this paper, I estimate the responsiveness of sentiment
 to sentiment, in the form of a Markov transition matrix.
 The probabilities in this matrix are calculated using a multinomial logit
 with maximum likelihood estimation.
 I test four models: The first is a simple MNL of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Model (2) adds year indicators to control for year effects, because of
 potential associations between sentiment and time (e.g.
 one might argue that sentiment in later years should be higher because
 of the survival of the peace negotiations).
 Model (3) adds covariates for violence and public opinion to the base model:
 log number of FARC actions and log peace approval ratings for that month.
 Model (4) includes both the year indicators and the violence and public
 opinion covariates.
 Thus, Model (1) is nested in each of the others, and Models (2) and (3)
 are nested in Model (4), the full model.
 I use pairwise likelihood ratio tests to compare each model with the model(s)
 in which it is nested.
 The results in Table 9 suggest that Model (4), with year, violence, and
 public opinion coefficients, is the best fit.
 The rest of the results proceed using that model.
 (See Table 11 for the AIC, BIC, and log likelihood values for each models;
 these are included for reference, although our interest is in the transition
 probabilities.)

 Overall, these results suggest that dire pronouncements from either negotiant

 If sentiment has a degree of resilience to shocks such as attacks, this
 suggests an alternate theory that explains why violence did not derail
 talks.
 However, these results do not support the prediction that low persistence
 of negative government sentiment in particular explains why FARC's attacks
 did not derail the talks, because negative government sentiment is quite
 persistent and also quite likely to occur in general.
 Nor does it appear that high levels of trust are built up over the course
 of negotiations.

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at patterns of statement issuance, another interesting result is
 that the statement most likely to follow a government statement is another
 statement from the government.
 Reasons for repetitive statements may be related to signalling or the significa
nce of audiences that statements are addressed to.
 For instance, the government might make a series of public denunciations
 to signal to the political opposition or the public that it is being tough
 on FARC.
 This theory fits in with the explanation for government regime volatility
 given in the HMM section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, we do not observe the same repetitions with FARC: although
 the statement following a low-sentiment FARC statement is most likely to
 be another FARC statement, a high-sentiment FARC statement is most likely
 to be followed by a government statement.
 This may be because FARC has relatively fewer statements so it is more
 likely that a government statements occurs in between.

\begin_layout Standard
Do actors respond to sentiment with the same level of sentiment, similar
 to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 strategy? Our ability to answer this question is limited by statistical
 power.
 Contrary to my hypothesis, when a high FARC statement is followed by a
 government statement, the latter is more likely to be low rather than high.
 We are unable to conclude with statistical significance that the government
 is more likely to respond to low FARC statements with high rather than
 low sentiment.
 Unfortunately, although the results show that FARC is more likely to respond
 to either kind of government statement with high (positive) sentiment,
 these findings are not statistically significant either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the transition probabilities suggest that high-sentiment responses
 are more likely across the board, whether or not the other party previously
 issued a high or low statement, and that low government sentiment is common.
 However, these results should be taken with a grain of salt because actors
 rarely respond to each other's statements and each is more likely to issue
 multiple statements in bursts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary of findings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The levels of willingness estimated in the HMM suggest higher persistence
 of sentiment for FARC and more volatile regime-switching for the government,
 which may be explained by theories about audiences and divisions within
 politics/society.
 Although an association between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

willingness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seriousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the volume of activity from the negotiating table was not found, the
 actors' willingness does predict the sentiment of joint statements.
 Of course, further research is needed to connect these results to the final
 outcome and the peace agreement.
 Conciliatory statements and the resilience of sentiment are potential explanati
ons for why talks do not fall apart in spite of violence.
 Although statistically significant support for tit-for-tat sentiment responsive
ness was not found, bursts of statements from a single actor provide insight
 into the persistence of sentiment or into how these statements may address
 different constituencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is a first attempt at applying sentiment analysis methods to
 the study of conflict negotiation.
 Estimating the state of a negotiation process can contribute to research
 on the outcome in terms of agreement provisions and peace durability, as
 well as research on bargaining and violence during talks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from the HMM model indicate different trends of persistence
 and volatility for the FARC and government, respectively.
 These findings are consistent with the theory that the government uses
 statements to address different audiences that have different concerns,
 such as the public, the military, and FARC, and suggests that further research
 might focus on why the behavior of state and nonstate actors differs.
 Although it is not a causal explanation, the regime-switching model also
 suggests a potential theory for how the peace process may have survived
 crises such as FARC's kidnapping of a general and the infrastructure bombings.
 Further investigation, however, is needed to explore the relationship between
 the actors' willingness and the output of the peace process---namely, the
 final peace accord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sentiment responsiveness model, the only statistically significant
 results suggest that the government is more likely to respond with low
 sentiment to a high-sentiment FARC statement, rather than a tit-for-tat
 exchange where actors mirror each other's sentiment.
 More interesting, however, are the patterns of persistence within actors.
 A theoretical explanation for repetitive issuances of statements is consistent
 with the theory that governments address statements to many different audiences
; however, these bursts of texts from one actor may be more worthwhile to
 investigate than the back-and-forth between the two adversaries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On some technical notes, research building on this paper might consider
 measuring sentiment in ways other than LIWC.
 Using a general dictionary, and using very general categories such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have the advantages of being extendable to other conflicts or to non-conflict
 applications.
 However, a dictionary with political science-specific terms, or even conflict-s
pecific terms (e.g.
 terms that might refer to a specific leaders, locations, events, etc.) may
 be the way forward for more refined analysis and more specific results.
 Building custom dictionaries requires extensive background knowledge and
 time; however, as dictionaries such as LIWC are not available in all languages,
 custom dictionaries may be necessary for comparative research.
 Additionally, my use of a three-state model was guided by considerations
 of model fit, but the results suggest that a simpler model with a hardline/conc
iliatory dichotomy may be preferable.
 Surprising, too, were the findings that a sentiment-only model was as good
 of a fit as a model that included covariates for levels of public opinion
 and violence.
 Future HMM estimation could thus be considerably simpler than it was in
 this paper.
 With that said, substantive labelling of latent states is essentially a
 classification problem that could be optimized using machine learning technique
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This case study could be extended to the outcome of the negotiations by
 updating the data to include statements leading up to the August 2016 peace
 agreement announcement and the (future) referendum.
 Examining the relationship between the sentiment of texts from the peace
 process and the final agreement may enable us to predict peace survival
 from negotiations sentiment.
 Another interesting area of future inquiry is the Colombian government's
 imminent negotiations with the ELN, which could be a step toward extending
 these results to other conflicts and contexts.

Estimation: A note on fitting hidden Markov models using depmixS4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expectation-maximization algorithm used in fitting hidden Markov models
 to data, implemented in the depmixS4 R package, randomly generates start
 values by generating random uniform values for the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}(j)=P(S_{t}=j|O_{1:T},z_{1:T},\theta')$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are the observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are covariates, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

 is the set of initial model parameters.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "depmixs4"

\end_inset

 Even when the seed is set to a fixed value, the EM algorithm does not always
 produce the same results because it randomly assigns the initial state,
 meaning that it does not generate the same transition matrix every single
 time.
 It does, however, reliably generate a limited number of transition matrices:
 three different matrices for FARC, and four for the government.
 (The rows of these matrices may be arranged in different orders, but they
 are equivalent because substantive labelling of the states i.e.
 rows occurs subsequently.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matrices usually had identical values, but in a few cases differed by 0.001,
 or rarely by 0.01, because of rounding during fitting.) I fitted the model
 1,000 times for FARC and the government separately, and used the most frequentl
y occurring models (the selected FARC model occurred 596/1000 times, while
 the government model occurred 916/1000).
