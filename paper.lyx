\begin_layout Abstract
Peace negotiations can stretch on for years and are often marred by continued
 fighting, obfuscated by public bluffing, and complicated by internal factionali
zation.
 How can we assess whether progress is being made, measure actors' willingness
 to negotiate, or measure the impact of violent attacks on the peace process?
 This paper uses sentiment analysis as a new method that offers quantitative
 answers to these questions.
 With a new dataset of texts from the ongoing (2012-present) peace talks
 between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
 de Colombia (FARC), I use measures of textual sentiment to predict each
 actor's willingness to negotiate over time.
 I also model the responsiveness of sentiment to sentiment.

 in peace negotiations? Analysis of the progress of peace processes, such
 as in the Middle East, has tended to be case-specific or game theoretical.
 Often these accounts are complicated by an inability to discern whether
 actors are sincere and by the disconnect between unitary negotiants (government
, rebel) and the cacophony of factions that each contains.
 To date, some research has offered theories explaining the variable effect
 of violent attacks on derailing peace talks, and theories for the relationship
 between government concessions and the level of terrorist activity.
 Other research has examined the texts of peace agreements to better understand
 the relationship between peace survival and specific agreement provisions.
 However, there is no research that analyzes texts issued during ongoing
 peace negotiations, nor has sentiment analysis previously been used to
 study peace negotiations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper makes several original contributions.
 First, I collected a new dataset of texts from the Colombian government
 and FARC, in addition to jointly released statements, all of which were
 issued during an ongoing conflict and negotiation process (2012-2016).
 Second, I bring in several new methods from psychology and natural language
 processing for measuring that ineffable quantity, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I use text analysis techniques to model each actor's willingness to negotiate
 as a function of their textual sentiment.
 I also use sentiment analysis to model how one actor's sentiment responds
 to another actor's sentiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are obvious difficulties in quantifying the status of negotiations;
 however, understanding these processes has valuable real-world implications.
 Better measurement of the effects of attacks on often-fragile negotiations,
 for example, could indicate strategies that facilitate agreement and cut
 short a violent conflict.
 Understanding how sentiment responds to sentiment may yield insights about
 signalling and bluffing not only in peace negotiations but also in the
 exchanges between countries that avoid or lead down the path to war.

The Colombian conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) was founded in 1964 the aftermath
 of the ten-year period of civil war known as La Violencia.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The group's official name is Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia--Ejérci
to del Pueblo (People's Army), or FARC-EP.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Originally a Marxist insurgency seeking to overthrow the government, FARC's
 supporters were mainly communists and rural peasants.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CFR"

\end_inset

 The group's tactics included murder, kidnappings for ransom, disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion; less widely known abroad
 is their use of landmines, which have resulted in thousands killed or maimed,
 and their kidnapping and forced conscription of child soldiers.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has also contributed to violence and instability
 during the same period and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, violence,
 extortion.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the government
 as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several years.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 FARC's current circumstances stem from a major shift in the 1980s and 1990s,
 when the group began to tax cocaine producers but soon became involved
 in cocaine production itself, sparking the formation of right-wing paramilitary
 groups such as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense
 Forces of Colombia) that battled FARC about, inter alia, control over drug
 trafficking.

 Notorious until recently as the longest-running guerrilla insurgency in
 the Western Hemisphere, the violence has claimed the lives of more than
 200,000 civilians and displacing millions,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and FARC, the paramilitary groups, and the government have all been accused
 of human rights abuses.
 (The AUC was also labelled a terrorist organization and was involved in
 drug trafficking as well prior to being disbanded in the mid-2000s.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, significant
ly reducing the strength of FARC and other armed groups.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CFR"

\end_inset

 FARC's willingness to negotiate is generally attributed in part to this
 crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, commenced in the fall of 2012
 in Havana and have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos.
 The talks were limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 Despite negotiating preliminary agreements for the topics on the agenda,
 which will be included in the final peace deal, Santos's approval ratings
 have plummeted over the years, as has public optimism about the talks.
 An agreement faces not just the skepticism of the public but also vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe, as well as some members
 of the military, that initially disapproved of negotiating with FARC and
 oppose agreement provisions that, in their view, would give the former
 rebels political representation and amnesty instead of prosecution for
 crimes committed.

With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Their negotiating team, led by the rebel alias Ivan Marquez, is comprised
 of numerous Secretariat members and has included top members from key Fronts
 (regional subdivisions).
 Despite this high-ranking participation and the declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the killings of rural policemen to
 the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and have created an additional website about the peace
 process, which features the individual blogs of negotiators.

 however, it should be noted that president Santos and Timochenko signed
 a bilateral ceasefire agreement on June 22, 2016, and announced that they
 had reached a final deal on August 24, 2016, which will subsequently be

Why does it matter how talks are going? It is not a stretch to suggest that
 impressions or assessments of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 affect the views of the public, nor it is an exaggeration to claim that
 decisions made by negotiants during talks may be colored by answers to
 or beliefs about questions such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how hard are they pushing for their demands?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This paper offers new methods of measurement that get past the vagueness
 or relativism in the way these questions are stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer to the first question, whether the other party is serious about
 negotiations, is significant for two reasons.
 To use FARC-Colombia as our example: The government wants to know, given
 the political cost of continuing to negotiate, whether an avowedly Marxist-Leni
nist group will actually follow through on a peace deal that almost certainly
 would not include the implementation of a Marxist economic-political system.
 Second, regardless of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about FARC's seriousness or how hard they are bargaining behind closed
 doors, popular impressions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC is stalling for time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) will affect the government's bargaining behavior and demands in public
 and in private, its level of military operations, and certainly its rhetoric,
 as the government has to answer to its political opponents and, eventually,
 in the next cycle of elections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, peace talks are often characterized by mistrust and an inability
 to know whether the other party's statements are sincere.
 For instance, Santos's government long refused to stop military operations
 against FARC, and FARC frequently used its unilateral ceasefires to call
 for a bilateral ceasefire.
 The government's decision has been seen as a safeguard thwarting a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long con
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being played by FARC--that is to say, continued military operations would
 prevent FARC from using the negotiations as a cover to buy time to increase
 their military strength.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "battaglino_lodola"

\end_inset

 A variety of concerns likely contributed to the government's suspicions:
 first, the criticism of politicians such as Uribe; second, continuing FARC
 attacks; and third, the fact that negotiations may very well fall apart
 without producing an agreement for various reasons.
 Although this paper focuses only on the negotiation process leading up
 to a peace agreement, mistrust can extend to the implementation of a deal
 (e.g.
 FARC would be wary of disarming or giving up secret information such as
 its members' locations if it thought the government would renege).

As the above discussion suggests, current assessments of an actor's

 However, to date the analysis of peace negotiations has not utilized sentiment

 Instead, perhaps because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the focus of much of the empirical research in this field is on violence.

\end_inset

 A driving force underlying this research is the inability for one negotiant
 to discern whether the other is sincere, bluffing (potentially intererested
 in an agreement but overstating their demands to get a better deal), or
 uninterested in peace and stalling (to allow military forces to regroup),
 based on their words alone.

In other research on negotiations and violence, Bueno de Mesquita theorizes
 that violence increases after government concessions because more extreme
 members are left in control of their organization after moderate members
 accept the concessions.

\end_inset

 The peace process with FARC, with more than fifty regional fronts but a
 unified central command that has remained in control throughout the peace
 talks and is unquestioned in speaking for its fighters, does not exemplify
 a (perhaps unintentional) divide-and-conquer strategy of the kind discussed
 by Bueno de Mesquita.
 Nevertheless, this area of research underscores the fact that we are interested
 in understanding not just the effect of violence on peace talks, but also
 how events at the negotiating table affect the level of violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this discussion demonstrates, measuring actors' willingness to negotiate
 during a peace process can inform our understanding of violence during
 peace talks as well as our understanding of the dynamics of how agreements
 are or are not reached.
 This paper introduces a new tool for measuring actors' willingness to negotiate
 based on sentiment analysis of their actual words, and a new method for
 using sentiment to model the responsiveness of actors to each other's words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I present a regime-switching Markov model that estimates an actor's willingness
 to negotiate using measures of negative and positive emotion.
 To validate the results from this model, I predict there is a positive
 relationship between a predicted state of high willingness to negotiate
 and the sentiment and incidence of joint statements.
 When FARC and/or the government are predicted to be in a conciliatory rather
 than a hardline state, joint statements are more likely to occur and their
 sentiment is likely to be more positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also test the relationship between extremism and increased use of third-person
 plural pronouns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of the paper, I model the responsiveness of sentiment
 to sentiment using another Markov process.
 I hypothesize that actors are more likely to respond with the same level
 of sentiment.
 In other words, if FARC issues a statement with high (positive) sentiment,
 the following government statement is more likely to respond with high
 rather than low (negative) sentiment, and vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper uses an original dataset of (1) communiques issued by FARC, (2)
 statements of the Colombian government, and (3) joint communiques issued
 by the peace negotiators in Havana.
 The statements were scraped and parsed in Python in the original Spanish,
 thus avoiding the obvious pitfalls of inter-translator variance, loss of
 nuance through translation, etc.
 The data was collected from September 1, 2012, the month in which formal
 peace talks were announced, through May 31, 2016, the beginning of this
 project.
 Unfortunately, this excludes the months immediately preceding the announcement
 of a final peace agreement in August 2016.

 Because the government issues statements on all manner of topics besides
 FARC, a simple keyword search was used as an initial screening method.
 The implementation of this search differed slightly for 2012-2015 and 2016

 Altogether, the preliminary government dataset consisted of 509 documents
 published between September 1, 2012, and May 31, 2016.
 However, additional human screening of the statements was necessary to
 remove statements that contained the keywords but were (a) not relevant
 to the peace talks or (b) not reasonably attributable to the Colombian
 government.

 the former being words such articles or pronouns that are relatively devoid
 of content.
 Consequently, the LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.

\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 as a percentage.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated and augmented (e.g.
 additional Spanish synonyms for words translated from the English) by Ramírez-E

 The LIWC measures are admittedly crude word counts; the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest; and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual authors, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, the LIWC sentiment measures can reveal insights into the
 nature of the documents under analysis.
 Other measurement methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
 proved to be unsuitable, probably owing to the high variance in the word
 counts of documents.

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling hidden states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task is to use the shares of positive and negative
 sentiment in texts to model a Markov regime-switching model in which the
 latent regimes are discrete states that represent the government or FARC's
 willingness to negotiate.
 This model focuses on one actor at a time; in the second part of this paper,
 we will look at how sentiment responds to sentiment subsequently.
 In other words, we are interested in the random variable that represents
 FARC's (or the government's) willingness to negotiate--i.e.
 whether FARC is in a hardline or conciliatory state--which is directly
 unobservable, and is therefore hidden.
 However, we can observe a stream of FARC documents whose sentiment emanates
 from the latent state that FARC is in at the time.
 (For the purposes of simplifying this discussion, I assume a state space
 with two possible, discrete states, but the model can be generalized to
 any number of states.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hidden Markov model (HMM) is a special case of a Markov process.
 The sequence of hidden states is a Markov chain: the probabilities of being
 in a hardline or conciliatory state, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

, respectively, exhibit the Markov property, namely that the probability
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the realization of the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the realization of state at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 captures all information about what occurred prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 I assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is at a state that is hidden or unobservable; however, from
 each state we can observe its emissions, or symbols, 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{t}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of an observed emission 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the state

 The probability of a stream of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1},...O_{T}$

 is computed using the forward-backward algorithm, a procedure that optimizes
 the process of summing over all of the hidden state sequences that could
 have generated that the stream of observations.

In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of loessed
 sentiment measures, for example percent negative emotion words in FARC
 statements (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$
\end_inset

).
 We are interested in the corresponding sequence of hidden states which
 generated the sequence of emissions: for example 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{H},S_{H},S_{C},S_{H}).$
\end_inset

 We are also interested in the transition probabilities, the probability
 of moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}=S_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t+1}=S_{j}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discussion has used a discrete state space with two possible states;
 however, it can be generalized to a larger number of states.
 In some cases substantive/theoretical grounds may define an appropriate
 number of latent states for a HMM; however, because the spectrum from

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other applications of hidden Markov models, the number of states is not
 optimized because it and the labels attached to the states tend to determined
 by substantive criteria: e.g.
 in medical examples, values for various indicators of health that fall
 within certain ranges correspond to pre-set states, and in economic examples,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 markets are modelled with two states that clearly correspond with economic
 indicators.
 This paper uses a more agnostic approach.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To keep interpretation across the FARC and government models comparable,
 I specify the same number of latent states.
 The substantive interpretation of the model accommodates small numbers
 of latent states: for instance, two latent states would correspond to a
 dichotomy between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while three latent states might represent low, moderate, and high levels
 of willingness to negotiate, representing hardline, moderate and conciliatory
 regimes, respectively.
 However, as the number of states increases, the substantive interpretation
 of transition probabilities across these states becomes more challenging.
 Moreover, a higher number of states means that fitting the model becomes
 difficult because transitions between any two given states may be rare
 or not happen at all.
 I weigh these considerations against the models' log-likelihood, BIC, and
 AIC values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Labelling the states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because HMM estimation does not attach substantive labels to the states,
 such labelling must be done post-estimation.
 I explore two possible methods.
 First, I use the distributions of the negative and positive sentiment measures
 to rank the unlabelled states in order of the relative willingness to negotiate.
 For example, the state with the highest mean positive emotion and lowest
 mean negative emotion should correspond to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate state (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), while the state with the lowest mean positive emotion and the highest
 mean negative emotion should be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate state (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 I also use a multi-choice decision matrix to optimize the ranking of states
 based on the average sentiment measured in each unlabelled state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling sentiment response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper uses a simple Markov process to model the
 response of sentiment to sentiment.
 The irregularity of the data does present some challenges, as there are
 stretches in the time-ordered sequence of FARC and government texts where
 little alternation occurs.
 (For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F,F,F,G,G,G,G,F$
\end_inset

.) This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly twice
 as many statements from the government as from FARC and that both actors
 sometimes release multiple statements on the same day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume that the sequence of time-ordered statements during a time interval
 represents a single Markov process, like a back-and-forth debate in which
 each text responds to the document that immediately preceded it.
 This means that a FARC document could respond to a previous FARC document,
 or a government document could respond to a government document.
 Repetitive issuances, e.g.
 a series of low-sentiment documents, might reveal a strategy where actors
 make public denunciations, perhaps to get better terms at the negotiating
 table.
 Our main interest, however, is whether an actor's response mirrors the
 other actor's sentiment: for instance, if, following a FARC statement with
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, it is more likely that the following government statement is
 also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing Model (1) vs.
 (2) and model (3) vs.
 (4) shows that the inclusion of violence and public opinion covariates
 does little to improve fit.
 The improvement in BIC and AIC values in the two-state model over the one-state
 model demonstrates that a mixture is a better fit for the data than a single
 state.
 Focusing on the two FARC models, with and without covariates, the BIC values
 suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 optimizes the number of latent states: although 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 has a slightly better BIC value than 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 in both models, the improvement is marginal and is weighed against the
 consideration that the fewest possible number of latent states should be
 used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AIC values for the FARC models, however, as well as both the BIC and
 AIC values for the government models, favor a specification with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=5$
\end_inset

.
 However, these improvements in fit must be balanced against the tradeoff
 in the interpretability of results in a model with so many states (e.g.
 what is the substantive meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

?).
 Consequently, the following analysis will proceed with a HMM with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$

 latent states, and without public opinion and violence covariates.

Labelling the states

The latent states represent high, moderate, and low willingness to negotiate.

\begin_layout Standard
Across the board, the standard deviations relative to the means are high,
 due to the spread of the data and the fact that some states rarely occur,
 i.e.
 have few data points.
 The mean and median agree on their predictions, and positive sentiment
 for FARC and negative sentiment for the government do produce the same
 rankings, but the rankings based on negative sentiment contradict each
 other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently, the measures of central tendency are not ideal for labelling
 the hidden states.
 I use the MCDM R package to identify the optimal ranking based on several
 different methods for computing multi-criteria decisions.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "martin_mcdm"

\end_inset

 This ranking is based on maximizing mean positive emotion and minimizing
 mean negative emotion.
 The overall decision matrix ranking maps states 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3$

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moderate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (hardline), and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This result is robust to changing the measure of central tendency (i.e.
 median or mean) used.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
HMM results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Markov transition matrices shown below, respectively, represent the
 probabilities of regime switching for FARC and the government, estimated
 using the negative and positive emotion measures and labeled according
 to the results of the decision matrix.
 The values in the diagonals reflect the persistence of some states.
 For instance, when FARC is hardline (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness) or moderate, there is a high probability that it will continue
 to be hardline or moderate.
 When FARC is in a state of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate, however, it does not transition directly to a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state.
 For the government, on the other hand, the transition probabilities are
 more evenly dispersed.
 There are relatively higher probabilities that the government will transition
 to a state of moderate willingness from any state; but, for instance, when
 the government is in a moderate state of willingness, it is roughly equally
 likely to transition to a hardline or conciliatory state (
\begin_inset Formula $0.24$
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $0.28$
\end_inset

).
 These probabilities provide insight into whether states are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and shed light on the lasting impact of events such as violent attacks
 during negotiations (to be discussed below).

To better understand these results, we can examine the graphs below which

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These graphs indicate a number of surprising results: First and foremost,
 both FARC and the government spend little time in the moderate state, a
 result that suggests that a model with two latent states might actually
 have been preferable for ease of interpretation.
 Overall, the government's willingness to negotiate is more volatile, with
 frequent regime switching from low to high throughout the time interval.
 The irregularity and frequency of data (statements may be issued days,
 weeks, or months apart) explains some of this volatility: there are three
 times as many government documents than FARC documents.
 But although the higher frequency of government statements affects the
 appearance of the regime switching graph, the government does have lower
 probabilities of state persistence, as seen in the diagonal of the transition
 matrix.
 The higher probabilities in FARC's transition matrix diagonal also explain
 the group's less frequent regime switching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One likely substantive cause of the government's volatile transitions is
 that its statements must address many different audiences and groups: toward
 FARC, the government must be a tough negotiator; for domestic critics,
 the government must appease hawks' concerns about specific provisions such
 as seats in the legislature for ex-guerrillas or amnesty from prosecution;
 for the military, the government must reassure them of their place in the
 conflict and about concerns regarding potential prosecution of military
 personnel for acts committed during the war; for the international community,
 the government must pledge its commitment to peace as it possibly seeks
 regional or United Nations assistance with the implementation of any deal;
 and for the public, the government must convince them that an agreement
 will actually bring about peace, that the voices of victims of the conflict
 have been heard, and that they should vote in favor of the agreement if
 it is on a referendum.
 FARC, on the other hand, addresses its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

constituency,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rank and file fighters who will may need to be persuaded to demobilize;
 the government and occasionally the right wing (e.g.

The House of Representatives passed a bill in 2013 requiring that any deal
 from Havana must survive a referendum, but this was followed by wrangling
 in the constitutional court and various statements by the president suggesting
 that a popular vote would happen if an agreement was made but that this
 was not legally required.

\begin_layout Standard
Anecdotally we may consider some events in the peace timeline that are objective
ly likely to be associated with the government's willingness to negotiate.
 In June 2015, FARC launched a series of attacks including attacking police
 stations and bombing infrastructure such as oil pipelines in Norte de Santander
, Putumayo, and Nariño, resulting in an oil spill that caused severe environment
al damage and contaminated the water supply of thousands; and bombing power
 stations that supplied electricity to the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco.

 This time period coincides with an episode of frequent regime-switching
 observed in the government graph, but it coincides with a period of

\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate in the FARC model.
 Although bombings and conciliatory sentiment seem contradictory, it's possible
 that the conciliatory sentiments in FARC's statements during this period
 contributed to the peace talks surviving the campaign of attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The government's state of low willingness to negotiate in November 2014
 following FARC's kidnapping of a general seems consistent with common sense:

Although threatening to suspend or suspending talks (

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, with noisy and irregular data, matching events to states is imperfect
 and at best anecdotal.
 To evaluate the validity of the hidden Markov model, I use a simple regression
 of joint statement sentiment on the predicted states on the day that the
 joint statement was issued to test my hypothesis that there is a positive
 association between willingness to negotiate and joint sentiment.
 I also use a logistic regression to test the hypothesis that there is a
 positive association between conciliatory states (high willingness to negotiate
) and the issuing of joint statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the first hypothesis, high government willingness to negotiate,
 relative to low willingness, is correlated with increases in both positive
 and negative emotion, whereas FARC's high willingness state is associated
 with decreases in both types of sentiment.
 The relationship between state and the sentiment measures, in the first
 two columns of the table, should be taken with a grain of salt: the conclusion
 to be drawn here is that high willingness to negotiate is correlated with
 more frequent emotional language.
 The third column indicates contradictory but statistically insignificant
 conclusions: the FARC hardline state and government conciliatory states
 are associated with a higher ratio of positive to negative language.

Perhaps, however, we are simply interested in whether joint statement issuance

 Since joint statements can announce agreements on policy, as well as announceme

 be a metric for how much is being accomplished in the negotiations, and
 we want to know whether the hidden Markov model can predict them.
 The logistic regression in the table below uses date/state indicator variables

\begin_layout Subsection
Sentiment response results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the second part of this paper, I estimate the responsiveness of sentiment
 to sentiment, in the form of a Markov transition matrix.
 As discussed previously, the probabilities in this matrix are calculated
 using a multinomial logit with maximum likelihood estimation.
 I test four models: The first is a simple MNL of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Model (2) adds year indicators to control for year effects, because of
 potential associations between sentiment and time (e.g.
 one might argue that sentiment in later years should be higher than sentiment
 in earlier years because of the survival of the peace negotiations).
 Model (3) adds covariates for violence and public opinion to the base model,
 in the form of log transformed number of FARC actions recorded in that
 month and log transformed presidential approval ratings for that month.
 Model (4) includes both the year indicators and the violence and public
 opinion covariates.
 Thus, Model (1) is nested in all of the other models, and Models (2) and
 (3) are nested in Model (4).

 However, the log likelihood value suggests that the reduced model, (1),
 is actually the best fit.
 In the interest of parsimony, the following analysis will utilize model
 (1).
 I also use pairwise likelihood ratio tests (see Appendix).

Does sentiment respond to sentiment? There is a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 probability that the response to a low-sentiment government statement will
 be a low-sentiment statement from FARC, versus a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.14$
\end_inset

 probability that the response will be a high-sentiment FARC statement.
 On the other hand, there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.17$
\end_inset

 probability that the response to a high-sentiment government statement
 is a high-sentiment FARC statement, compared with a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 probability that it will be a low-sentiment FARC statement.
 (Another government statement is most likely to follow a government statement,
 for either level of sentiment.) This result seems promising: FARC seems
 more likely to respond to government statements with high positive sentiment.
 The government, on the other hand, is equally likely 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.08)$
\end_inset

 to respond with either level of sentiment to a low-sentiment FARC statement.
 Interestingly, the government is more likely 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.32)$
\end_inset

 to respond with a low-sentiment statement to a high-sentiment FARC statement
 and less likely to respond with a high-sentiment statement 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.23)$

\begin_layout Standard
The transition matrix provides a new method for answering some other questions
 about negotiations.
 We might ask whether sentiment is persistent or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and whether, for instance, a shock such as a terrorist attack might permanentl
y derail sentiment (and the peace process).
 Low government sentiment has a high probability 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.73)$
\end_inset

 of continuing in subsequent time periods, although it should be noted that
 this was also the most common state occurring in the data.
 High government sentiment is about as likely to persist 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.49)$
\end_inset

 than it is to be followed by any of the other states combined.
 FARC's persistence is lower, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0.33$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.40$
\end_inset

 for low and high sentiment, respectively, although this result may partly
 reflect the relatively fewer FARC statements in the dataset.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is a first attempt at applying text and sentiment analysis methods
 from psychology to the study of conflict negotiation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further research could build on this paper's findings in a number of ways.
 First of all, the dataset can be updated to include statements leading
 up to the August 2016 peace agreement announcement (and up to the future
 referendum on the agreement).
 Additional analysis could look at the relationship between the sentiment
 of texts from the peace process and the final document itself.
 Given that provisions of a peace agreement can predict whether peace will
 survive, much could be learned from the study of the process that produces
 such agreements.
 A comparative study would lend further credence to sentiment analysis as
 a measurement tool for the progress of peace talks; such data, however,
 is not always available from both sides of a conflict, nor are dictionaries
 such as LIWC available in all languages.
 Although using a general dictionary means that these results are more extendabl
e than they might have been with a dictionary specific to a particular conflict
 (e.g.
 one that includes terms specific to a war or its belligerents), developing
 a dictionary with political science-specific terms would be advantageous
 for more refined analysis that goes beyond simply negative or positive
 sentiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are a number of methodological advances that further research
 might undertake.
 Labelling the latent states estimated by a hidden Markov model is essentially
 a classification problem that could be resolved using machine learning
 techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the relationship between sentiment and the level of violence is
 of obvious importance.
 With disaggregated data on the types of violence (e.g.
 bombings, kidnappings, murders, etc.), further research may be able to unearth
 the relationships between specific kinds of attacks and sentiment, and
 reveal insights about peace process spoilers.

Expectation-maximization algorithm in fitting hidden Markov models using
 depmixS4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expectation-maximization algorithm used in fitting hidden Markov models
 to data using the depmixS4 R package randomly generates start values by
 generating random uniform values for the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}(j)=P(S_{t}=j|O_{1:T},z_{1:T},\theta')$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are the observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are covariates, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

 is the set of initial model parameters.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "depmixs4"

\end_inset

 Even when the seed is set to a fixed integer in R, the EM algorithm does
 not always produce the same results, meaning that it does not reliably
 generate the same transition matrix.
 It does, however, reliably generate a limited number of transition matrices:
 three different matrices for FARC, and four for the government.
 I fitted the model 1,000 times for each of FARC and the government and
 used the most frequently occurring model (596/1000 for FARC, 916/1000 for
 government).
