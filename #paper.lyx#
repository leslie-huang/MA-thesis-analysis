\begin_layout Abstract
As peace negotiations can stretch on for years and are often marred by continued
 violence, bluffing, or internal factionalization, how can we assess whether
 progress is being made or predict whether talks will yield an agreement?
 In the international relations literature, game theoretical and cross-country
 approaches have been used to make predictions, but with limited applicability.
 This paper uses sentiment analysis as a new method that can answer these
 questions.
 Using texts from the ongoing (2012-present) peace talks between the Colombian
 government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC),
 I use sentiment analysis to reveal whether actors are in hardline or conciliato
ry state.
 I also show that one actor's sentiment (i.e.

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

negative

) responds to the other actor's sentiment.

This paper offers several original contributions: a new dataset of government
 and rebel/terrorist texts as well as jointly released statements, all issued
 during an ongoing conflict; and the use of new methods to measure the somewhat
 ineffable quality of the tenor of peace talks.

The conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colombia's conflict with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC;
 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [also known as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucio
narias de Colombia--Ejército del Pueblo, or FARC-EP]) began in the aftermath
 of the ten-year period of civil war known as La Violencia.
 Originally founded in 1964 as a Marxist insurgency, FARC sought to overthrow
 the government, and its base was communists and rural peasants.
 (CFR) FARC's tactics included murder, kidnappings for ransom and disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion.
 Now notorious as the longest-running and only remaining guerrilla insurgency
 in the Western Hemisphere, the violence has claimed the lives of more than
 200,000 civilians and displacing millions.
 (BBC News) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has also contributed to violence and instability
 during the same period and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, violence,
 extortion.
 (CFR) ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the
 government as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several
 years.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s and 1990s, FARC's activities expanded to include the drug trade,
 beginning with taxation of cocaine producers but eventually cocaine production
 itself.
 (Wilson) This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups such
 as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces
 of Colombia), whose bloody battles with FARC were often about control over
 drug trafficking.
 (Wilson) FARC, the paramilitary groups, and the government have all been
 accused of human rights abuses.
 In the last 20 years, FARC's involvement with cocaine trafficking has prompted
 action from the U.S.
 government, and it has caught international attention with kidnappings
 for ransom and assassinations of political and military figures.
 Less widely known abroad is FARC's use of landmines, which have resulted
 in thousands killed or maimed, and their kidnapping and forced conscription
 of children.

Peace process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, resulting
 in significant reductions the strength of FARC as well as other armed groups.
 (CFR) FARC's willingness to negotiate is generally attributed in part to
 this crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, began in the fall of 2012 in
 Havana.
 The talks are limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 The talks have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos, who succeeded
 Uribe in 2010 and was re-elected in 2014 during the peace negotiations.
 As the talks have dragged on, Santos's approval ratings have plummeted
 along with public optimism about the talks, and he has faced the vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe, as well as members
 of the military, that initially disapproved of negotiating with FARC and
 oppose any agreement provisions that, in their view, give the former rebels
 political representation instead of prosecution for crimes committed.
 [New York Times]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the peace negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Numerous Secretariat members are on their negotiating team, led by the
 rebel alias Ivan Marquez.
 Despite this high-ranking participation and the declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the kidnapping of rural policemen
 to the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and maintain an active Internet presence--their website
 even features the blogs of peace negotiators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project examines texts from the peace process up until May 31, 2016;
 however, it must be noted that president Santos and Timochenko signed a
 bilateral ceasefire agreement on June 22, 2016, and announced that they
 had reached a final deal on August 24, 2016, which will subsequently need
 to be approved by popular referendum.
 [Guardian] Although the peace agreement is not yet final, the bilateral
 ceasefire is significant because the government has long refused to stop
 military operations against FARC during the negotiations, even during FARC's
 unilateral ceasefires (violations of which will be discussed below).
 That decision has been seen as a safeguard to thwart a

 is to say, continued military operations prevent FARC from using the negotiatio

Sentiment analysis of extremist texts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relevant analysis of extremist texts (

\end_inset

 being any form of written statement) has emanated from James Pennebaker
 and coauthors in the field of psychology.
 With a focus on divining the emotional and psychological states of individuals,
 Pennebaker's research has found associations between frequency of usage
 of particular types of words and emotional, cognitive, and social attributes.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) In analysis of extremist texts from American Nazi
 and militant animal rights organizations, they found that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

third-person plural pronouns are the single best predictor of extremism...
 suggest[ing] that the group is defining itself to a large degree by the
 existence of an oppositional group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung) Consistent with that result, their study of texts
 issued by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri of al Qaeda found greater
 frequency in the use of third-person plural pronouns, as well as emotional
 words and first-person pronouns.
 The data in that study differs in several significant ways from the data
 in this paper: those texts were translated, were authored by specific individua
ls,

; and indeed, the question of whether presidents themselves or speechwriters
 or staff members have actually authored texts has been explored in the

 and were originally oral rather than printed texts.
 Other analyses of extremist texts have tended to focus on large corpora
 of online postings, for instance the emotional affect of posts on extremist
 Internet forums (Abbasi and Chen), network analysis of the authors of extremist
 blogs, (Chau and Xu) and content analysis of extremist documents.
 (Smith et al) Text analysis of politicians, on the other hand, tends to
 have a different focus, but one study of speeches of a former Australian
 prime minister, John Howard, found varying levels of fear-mongering rhetoric.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I use an original dataset of communiques and statements issued separately
 by FARC and the Colombian government, and joint communiques issued by the
 peace negotiators in Havana.
 All documents are in the original Spanish, thus avoiding the obvious pitfalls
 of inter-translator variance, loss of nuance through translation, etc.
 The time period being studied is 2012 through May 31, 2016 (the latter
 bound was determined by the beginning of this project).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The documents were collected using web scraping in Python from the following
 sources: First, every communique from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Comunicados
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section of the official FARC website was scraped, [CITE] for a total of
 120, of which 11 that were issued prior to 2012 were removed.
 Some communiques were authored by specific FARC generals; however, this
 paper's analysis does not examine individual-level authorship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For joint statements, every communique from the official Mesa de Conversaciones
 (Table for Dialogue) website was scraped, [CITE] for a total of 70 documents.
 This excludes reports issued by the negotiators, which have a different
 purpose, format, and audience than the statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, statements from the Colombian government were scraped from the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sala de Prensa
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Press Room) section of the Colombian president's website.
 [(http://wp.presidencia.gov.co)] The same president, Santos, has been in office
 during the peace talks, conveniently obviating any variance that might
 result from different administrations.
 Because the government issues statements on all manner of topics besides
 FARC, a simple keyword search was used.
 The method of scraping differed slightly for 2012-2015 and 2016 because
 of differences in the structures of the current and archived presidential
 websites.

 Altogether, the preliminary government dataset consisted of 545 documents
 published between January 1, 2012, and June 1, 2016.
 However, additional human screening of the statements was necessary to
 remove statements that contained the keywords but were (a) not relevant
 to the peace talks or (b) not reasonably attributable to the Colombian
 government.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was developed by Pennebaker.
 [INSERT CITES] LIWC in English has been used to analyze texts written by
 individuals from terrorist organizations (and translated into English),
 e.g.
 transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) The LIWC methodology reflects Pennebaker et al.'s
 approach to text analysis, which is centered around 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

examin[ing] people's social and psychological states by analyzing their
 use of function and emotion words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung 453), the former being relatively neutral words such
 articles or pronouns rather than words that are content- or document-specific.
 Consequently, LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pronouns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that are the aforementioned function words, or types of emotion (within
 the categories of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anxiety or fear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)--are counted, and their percentage of total words in the document is calculate
d.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated from the English-language LIWC and augmented
 with additional words (e.g.
 synonyms for included words in Spanish) by Ramírez-Esparza, Pennebaker,
 García, and Suriá Martínez.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LIWC measures are admittedly crude word counts, the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest, and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual people, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, they reveal insights into the nature of the documents under
 analysis.
 This paper focuses on the following categories: positive emotion, negative
 emotion, and third-person plural pronouns, which research from psychology
 has found to be used at higher rates by extremist groups.

Modelling hidden states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task in this paper is to use the relative frequencies
 of word categories to model latent states that represent whether an actor
 is hardline or conciliatory.
 (For the purposes of this discussion, I assume two possible discrete states.)
 In other words, given a sequence of FARC documents, we are interested in
 the random variable that represents whether FARC is in a hardline state
 or a conciliatory state--a hidden state, as negotiants may bluff to get
 better terms.
 This model focuses on one actor at a time; we will look at how sentiment
 responds to sentiment subsequently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hidden (or latent) Markov model (HMM) is a special case of a Markov
 process.
 At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is at a state that is hidden or unobservable; however, from
 each state we can observe emissions, or symbols.
 In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of sentiment
 measures (e.g.
 percent negative emotion words in FARC statements), e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$
\end_inset

.
 We are interested in the corresponding sequence of hidden states which
 generated the sequence of emissions: e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{H},S_{H},S_{C},S_{H}),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 are the hardline and conciliatory states, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sequence of states is a Markov chain: the probabilities of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 exhibit the Markov property, namely, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the realization of the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the realization of state at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 captures all information about what occurred prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 I also assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Additionally, the probability of an observed emission 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

Modelling sentiment response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper examines a time-ordered series of documents
 issued by FARC and the government to examine whether sentiment can predict
 sentiment.
 This is to say, if a FARC issues a statement with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, does that predict the government's response will also have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment? I assume that each text responds to the document that immediately
 preceded it.
 The irregularity of the data presents some challenges, as little alternation
 occurs in some stretches of the sequence of texts.
 (For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F,F,F,G,G,G,G,F$
\end_inset

.) This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly twice
 as many statements from the government as from FARC.
 This also does not take into account the amount of time between documents.

Modelling this requires some new measures.
 Based on previous research that has shown that in normal usage, positive
 emotion words occur twice as frequently as negative emotion words (Pennebaker

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 sentiment, taking on the former value if the proportion of positive words
 is at least twice the proportion of negative words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 otherwise.
 Although crude, this indicator is less noisy than using raw LIWC measures.
