\begin_layout Abstract
As peace negotiations can stretch on for years and are often marred by continued
 violence, bluffing, or internal factionalization, how can we assess whether
 progress is being made or predict whether talks will yield an agreement?
 In the international relations literature, game theoretical and cross-country
 approaches have been used to make predictions, but with limited applicability.
 This paper uses sentiment analysis as a new method that can answer these
 questions.
 Using texts from the ongoing (2012-present) peace talks between the Colombian
 government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC),
 I use word usage ratios to reveal whether actors are in hardline or conciliator
y state.
 I also show that one actor's sentiment (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative

) responds to the other actor's sentiment.

The Colombian conflict.

\begin_layout Standard
FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia / Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia) was founded in 1964 the aftermath of the ten-year period
 of civil war known as La Violencia.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The group refers to itself as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia--Ejérc
ito del Pueblo (People's Army), or FARC-EP.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Originally a Marxist insurgency, FARC sought to overthrow the government,
 and its base was communists and rural peasants.
 (CFR) FARC's tactics included murder, kidnappings for ransom and disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion.
 Notorious as the longest-running guerrilla insurgency in the Western Hemisphere
, the violence has claimed the lives of more than 200,000 civilians and
 displacing millions.
 (BBC News) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has also contributed to violence and instability
 during the same period and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, violence,
 extortion.
 (CFR) ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the
 government as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several
 years.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s and 1990s, FARC's activities began to tax cocaine producers
 but soon became involved in cocaine production itself.
 (Wilson) This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups such
 as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces
 of Colombia), which battled with FARC about control over drug trafficking.
 (Wilson) FARC, the paramilitary groups, and the government have all been
 accused of human rights abuses.
 In the last 20 years, FARC's involvement with cocaine trafficking has prompted
 action from the U.S.
 government, and it has caught international attention with kidnappings
 for ransom and assassinations of political and military figures.
 Less widely known abroad is FARC's use of landmines, which have resulted
 in thousands killed or maimed, and their kidnapping and forced conscription
 of child soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, resulting
 in significant reductions the strength of FARC as well as other armed groups.
 (CFR) FARC's willingness to negotiate is generally attributed in part to
 this crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, began in the fall of 2012 in
 Havana.
 The talks are limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 The talks have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos, who succeeded
 Uribe in 2010.
 Despite negotiating preliminary agreements for the agenda topics, which
 will be included in the final peace deal, Santos's approval ratings have
 plummeted over the years along with public optimism about the talks.
 A deal faces not just the skepticism of the public but also vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe, as well as members
 of the military, that initially disapproved of negotiating with FARC and
 oppose agreement provisions that, in their view, would give the former
 rebels political representation and amnesty instead of prosecution for
 crimes committed.

\begin_layout Standard
With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the peace negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Numerous Secretariat members are on their negotiating team, led by the
 rebel alias Ivan Marquez.
 Despite this high-ranking participation and the declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the kidnapping of rural policemen
 to the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and have created an additional website about the peace
 process, which features the individual blogs of negotiators.

This project examines texts from the peace process up until May 31, 2016;
 however, it should be noted that president Santos and Timochenko signed
 a bilateral ceasefire agreement on June 22, 2016, and announced that they
 had reached a final deal on August 24, 2016, which will subsequently be
 voted on in a popular referendum.

Sentiment analysis of extremist texts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relevant analysis of extremist texts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

text
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being any form of written statement) has emanated from James Pennebaker
 and coauthors in the field of psychology.
 With a focus on divining the emotional and psychological states of individuals,
 Pennebaker's research has found associations between frequency of usage
 of particular types of words and emotional, cognitive, and social attributes.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) In analysis of extremist texts from American Nazi
 and militant animal rights organizations, they found that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

third-person plural pronouns are the single best predictor of extremism...
 suggest[ing] that the group is defining itself to a large degree by the
 existence of an oppositional group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung) Consistent with that result, their study of texts
 issued by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri of al Qaeda found greater
 frequency in the use of third-person plural pronouns, as well as emotional
 words and first-person pronouns.
 The data in that study differs in several significant ways from the data
 in this paper: those texts were translated, were authored by specific individua
ls,
\begin_inset Foot

Some of the FARC statements are signed by specific individuals, but in this
 paper the author is simply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 There is significant heterogeneity in the nature of government statements,
 some of which are transcripts of speeches delivered by president Santos,
 but the author is

; and indeed, the question of whether presidents themselves or speechwriters
 or staff members have actually authored texts has been explored in the

 and were originally oral rather than printed texts.
 Other analyses of extremist texts have tended to focus on large corpora
 of online postings, for instance the emotional affect of posts on extremist
 Internet forums (Abbasi and Chen), network analysis of the authors of extremist
 blogs, (Chau and Xu) and content analysis of extremist documents.
 (Smith et al) Text analysis of politicians, on the other hand, tends to
 have a different focus, but one study of speeches of a former Australian
 prime minister, John Howard, found varying levels of fear-mongering rhetoric.

Peace negotiation literature: predicting success of ongoing talks, existing
 measurement methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Colombian peace negotiations exemplify numerous questions posed in internati
onal relations and war and peace studies which, to date, have been answered
 with approaches that do not utilize texts produced from the peace process
 and do not attempt to measure the ineffable qualities like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

tenor of the talks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mood of the government/rebel group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, impressions or assessments of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how the talks are going
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inevitably affect the views of the negotiants as well as the public, and
 it is not a stretch to suggest that decisions made during talks may be
 colored by assessments of questions such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how serious is the other party about peace?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how hard are they pushing for their demands?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer to the first question, whether the other party is serious about
 negotiations, is significant for two reasons.
 First, (for example), the government needs to know whether FARC is serious
 about a peace deal that certainly would not include the implementation
 of a Marxist economic-political system.
 Second, regardless of what the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is about FARC's seriousness, popular impressions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC is toying with the government and the government isn't driving a hard
 enough bargain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) can especially affect a government's negotiating behavior, demands, and
 its level of military operations, as it has to answer to political opponents
 and, eventually, the next cycle of elections.
 For instance, the government long refused to stop military operations against
 FARC, and FARC frequently used its unilateral ceasefires to call for a
 bilateral ceasefire.
 The government's decision has been seen as a safeguard thwarting a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long con
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being played by FARC--that is to say, continued military operations would
 prevent FARC from using the negotiations as a cover to buy time to increase
 their military strength.
 (NOREF) Negotiations, after all, may very well fall apart without producing
 an agreement, because of (1) an inability to agree on settlements or (2)
 changes in relative military strength that cause either side to change
 its mind about deciding the outcome of the conflict at the negotiating
 table rather than on the battlefield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this discussion suggests, an assessment about an actor's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seriousness about peace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may be based on the level and nature of ongoing violence.
 Kydd and Walter, for instance, offer a game theoretical explanation for
 why violence during peace negotiations can sometimes derail talks by revealing
 information about an actor's capacity or willingness to control extremist
 factions.
 (Kydd) A driving force behind this research and these questions is the
 inability for one negotiant to discern whether the other is sincere, bluffing
 (potentially intererested in an agreement but overstating their demands
 to get a better deal), or uninterested in peace and stalling (to allow
 military forces to regroup), based on their words alone.

This paper introduces a new tool for measuring the sentiment of actors during
 ongoing peace talks based on the actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

talk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 not just the level of violence.
 Other research has used violence or attacks to gauge the status of talks,
 but in fact we may better understand the effect of violence--or the motivation
 for attacks--on peace talks if we understand the status of the talks prior
 to the violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FARC negotiations are a fascinating example of the relationship between
 violence and negotiations.
 From the beginning of the negotiations, FARC called for a bilateral ceasefire,
 which the government denied up until just weeks before the final peace
 deal was announced in August 2016.
 Prior to that, FARC declared numerous unilateral ceasefires, although given
 the number of violations recorded by monitoring groups, it is debatable
 whether all of them should be truly considered ceasefires.
 The kidnappings or killings of policemen and bombings in rural departments
 (provinces) did not derail talks.
 Talks were suspended only on two occasions: first, when a high-ranking
 general was kidnapped, and second, when FARC escalated a campaign of bombings
 of infrastructure such as power plants and oil pipelines, resulting in
 an oil spill that was the worst environmental disaster in Colombian history.
 Meanwhile, the government, under a steady hail of pressure from right-wing
 politicians, continued military operations; despite that, FARC did not
 walk away from the negotiating table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other research on negotiations and violence, Bueno de Mesquita argues
 that violence increases after government concessions because more extreme
 members are left in control of their organization after moderate members
 accept the concessions.
 (Bueno de Mesquita) The peace process with FARC, with fifty regional blocs
 but a unified central command that has remained in control throughout the
 peace talks, does not exemplify a government employing a divide-and-conquer
 strategy of the kind discussed by Bueno de Mesquita.

This paper uses an original dataset of communiques and statements issued
 separately by FARC and the Colombian government, and joint communiques
 issued by the peace negotiators in Havana.
 The statements were scraped and parsed in Python by the author.
 All are in the original Spanish, thus avoiding the obvious pitfalls of
 inter-translator variance, loss of nuance through translation, etc.
 The time period being studied is September 1, 2012, through May 31, 2016,

 and the beginning of this project.

 (Press Room) section of the Colombian president's website.
 [(http://wp.presidencia.gov.co)] The same president, Santos, has been in office
 during the peace talks, conveniently obviating variance that might result
 from different administrations.
 Because the government issues statements on all manner of topics besides
 FARC, a simple keyword search was used as an initial screening method.
 The implementation of this search differed slightly for 2012-2015 and 2016
 because of differences in the structures of the current and archived presidenti
al websites.

 This was executed with a basic search script in Python during the scraping.

 were scraped.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Altogether, the preliminary government dataset consisted of 509 documents
 published between September 1, 2012, and May 31, 2016.
 However, additional human screening of the statements was necessary to
 remove statements that contained the keywords but were (a) not relevant
 to the peace talks or (b) not reasonably attributable to the Colombian
 government.

\begin_layout Standard
The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was developed by Pennebaker.
 [INSERT CITES] LIWC in English has been used to analyze texts written by
 individuals from terrorist organizations (and translated into English),
 e.g.
 transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) The LIWC methodology reflects Pennebaker et al.'s
 approach to text analysis, which is centered around 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

examin[ing] people's social and psychological states by analyzing their
 use of function and emotion words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung 453), the former being relatively neutral words such
 articles or pronouns rather than words that are content- or document-specific.
 Consequently, LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pronouns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that are the aforementioned function words, or types of emotion (within
 the categories of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there are subcategories such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anxiety or fear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)--are counted, and their percentage of total words in the document is calculate
d.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated from the English-language LIWC and augmented
 (e.g.
 additional Spanish synonyms for words translated from the English) by Ramírez-E
sparza, Pennebaker, García, and Suriá Martínez.
 This paper uses the following categories: positive emotion, negative emotion,
 and third-person plural pronouns, which research from psychology has found
 to be used at higher rates by extremist groups.
 (Pennebaker and Chung)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LIWC measures are admittedly crude word counts; the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest; and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual people, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, they may reveal insights into the nature of the documents
 under analysis.
 Moreover, demonstrating the success or limits of measurement using a general
 rather than conflict-specific dictionary would make this paper's results
 applicable to other contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Modelling hidden states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task in this paper is to use the relative frequencies
 of word categories in a Markov regime-switching model that represents whether
 an actor (either the government or FARC) is in a latent, or hidden, state
 of being hardline or conciliatory.
 For the purposes of simplifying this discussion, I assume two possible
 discrete states.
 In other words, given a sequence of FARC documents, we are interested in
 the random variable that represents whether FARC is in a hardline state
 or a conciliatory state--a hidden state, as negotiants may bluff to get
 better terms.
 This model focuses on one actor at a time; in the second part of this paper,
 we will look at how sentiment responds to sentiment subsequently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hidden (or latent) Markov model (HMM) is a special case of a Markov
 process.
 At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is at a state that is hidden or unobservable; however, from
 each state we can observe emissions, or symbols.
 In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of sentiment
 measures (e.g.
 percent negative emotion words in FARC statements), e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$
\end_inset

.
 We are interested in the corresponding sequence of hidden states which
 generated the sequence of emissions: e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{H},S_{H},S_{C},S_{H}),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 are the hardline and conciliatory states, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sequence of states is a Markov chain: the probabilities of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 exhibit the Markov property, namely, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the realization of the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the realization of state at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 captures all information about what occurred prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 I also assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Additionally, the probability of an observed emission 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The probabilities of moving from each state to each other state are transition
 probabilities, represented as the entries in the transition matrix

 I will use the depmixS4 package in R to calculate these values.

\begin_layout Standard
This discussion has used a discrete state space with two possible states;
 however, it can be generalized to a larger number of states.
 Although in some cases substantive/theoretical grounds may define an appropriat
e number of latent states for a HMM, for the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to

Optimizing the number of states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ideal number of states can be identified by the Bayesian information
 criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values.
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other applications of hidden Markov models, the number of states is not
 optimized because it and the labels attached to the states tend to determined
 by substantive criteria: e.g.
 in medical examples, values for various indicators of health that fall
 within certain ranges correspond to pre-set states, and in economic examples,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 markets are modelled with two states that clearly correspond with economic
 indicators.
 This paper uses a more agnostic approach.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To keep interpretation across models comparable, the same number of latent
 states should be specified.
 The substantive interpretation of the model accommodates small numbers
 of latent states: for instance, two latent states would correspond to a
 dichotomy between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while three latent states might represent low, moderate, and high levels
 of willingness to negotiate, representing hardline, moderate and conciliatory
 regimes, respectively.
 However, as the number of states increases, the substantive interpretation
 of transition probabilities across these states becomes more challenging.
 Moreover, a higher number of states means that fitting the model becomes
 difficult because transitions between any two given states may be rare
 or not happen at all.
 These considerations will be weighed against the models' log-likelihood,
 BIC, and AIC values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Labelling the states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because hidden Markov model estimation does not attach substantive labels
 to the states, such labelling must be done post-estimation.
 I explore two possible methods.
 First, I use the distributions of estimated states over the negative and
 positive sentiment measures to rank the states in order of the relative
 willingness to negotiate.
 For example, the state with the highest mean positive emotion and lowest
 mean negative emotion should correspond to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate state (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), while the state with the lowest mean positive emotion and the highest
 mean negative emotion should be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate state (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 I also use a multi-choice decision matrix implemented in R to optimize
 the ranking based on the sentiment measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Modelling sentiment response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper also uses Markov chains to model the response
 of sentiment to sentiment.
 A fundamental assumption is that the sequenece of time-ordered statements
 during a time interval represents a single Markov process.
 (In the following section, I will present results for the entire period
 of negotiations covered in this paper, and I will also compare results
 from regimes bounded by structural breaks.) This is to say, if a FARC issues
 a statement with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, is it likely that the next statement is a government statement
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment? I estimate the probabilities in the Markov transition matrix
 for this process using a multinomial logit.

Like before,

 The diagonal reflects the probability of that each state is persistent,
 while the entries 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{F_{H},G_{H}},P_{F_{L},G_{L}},P_{G_{H},F_{H}},P_{G_{L},F_{L}}$
\end_inset

 represent the probability that an actor will respond with the same sentiment
 as the previous statement from the other actor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The irregularity of the data does present some challenges, as there are
 stretches in the time-ordered sequence of FARC and government texts where
 little alternation occurs.
 (For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F,F,F,G,G,G,G,F$
\end_inset

.) This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly twice
 as many statements from the government as from FARC and that both actors
 sometimes release multiple statements on the same day.
 I assume that each text responds to the document that immediately preceded
 it.
 Our interest goes beyond looking at how FARC responds to the government
 and vice versa: repetitive issuances such as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-sentiment government statement following another 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-sentiment government statement might reveal a strategy where actors make
 public denunciations to get better terms at the negotiating table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate overall sentiment of these texts, I created a new measure based
 on research showing that in normal usage, positive emotion words occur
 twice as frequently as negative emotion words (Pennebaker and Chung).
 I constructed an indicator for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, taking on the former value if the proportion of positive words
 is at least twice the proportion of negative words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Although crude, this indicator is less noisy than using raw LIWC measures.
 I constructed another categorical variable for sentiment-party, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC/low,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC/high,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

government/low,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and

 I also included models for FARC and the government that include covariates

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing Model (1) vs.
 (2) and model (3) vs.
 (4) shows that the inclusion of covariates does little to improve fit.
 The improvement in BIC and AIC values in the two-state model over the one-state
 model demonstrates that a mixture is a better fit for the data than a single
 state.
 Focusing on the two FARC models, with and without covariates, the BIC values
 suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 optimizes the number of latent states: although 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 has a slightly better BIC value than 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 in both models, the improvement is marginal and is weighed against the
 consideration that the fewest possible number of latent states should be
 chosen.
 The AIC values for the FARC models, however, as well as both the BIC and
 AIC values for the government models, favor higher order specifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, these improvements in fit must be balanced against the tradeoff
 in the interpretability of results in a model with so many states (e.g.
 what is the substantive meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1/5 willingness to negotiate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transition for 1/5 to 2/5 hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?).
 Consequently, the following analysis will proceed with a HMM with three
 latent states, or regimes.
 The violence and public opinion covariates are not included.
 The latent states represent high, moderate, and low willingness to negotiate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in the Methods section, the hidden Markov model estimation
 does not attach substantive labels to numbered states, nor does it order
 the states (i.e.
 by magnitude).

\begin_layout Standard
Across the board, the standard deviations relative to the means are high,
 due to the spread of the data and the fact that some states rarely occur,
 i.e.
 have few data points (shown on plots below).
 The mean and median agree on their predictions, although they produce a
 different ranking (labelling) for each actor/sentiment type, as seen in
 the table.
 Because those labels are not conclusive, I use the MCDM R package to identify
 the optimal ranking based on several different methods for computing multi-crit
eria decisions [Ceballos Martin].
 This ranking is based on maximizing positive emotion percent and minimizing
 negative emotion percent (i.e.
 the choice ranked first is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willing to negotiate state).
 As it turns out, all of the methods rank the latent states in the same
 way: states

 and

 This result is robust to changing the measure of central tendency (i.e.
 median or mean) used in the decision matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Markov transition matrices shown below, respectively, represent the
 probabilities of regime switching for FARC and the government, estimated
 using the negative and positive emotion measures and labeled according
 to the results of the decision matrix.
 The values in the diagonals reflect the persistence of some states.
 For instance, when FARC is hardline, there is a high probability that it
 will continue to be hardline.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These graphs indicate a number of surprising results: First and foremost,
 it appears that FARC's willingness to negotiate has usually been medium
 to high.
 The government's willingness, however, seems more volatile, with a high
 level of regime switching especially during 2013 and 2015.
 Interestingly, the government tends to shift from low to high and rarely
 was in the moderate state, with the exception of a period from mid-2014
 to mid-2015, during which FARC was also in a moderate state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The irregularity and frequency of data (statements may be issued days, weeks,
 or months apart) explains some of this volatility.
 There are three times as many government documents than FARC documents,
 and government statements are issued more frequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One likely cause of the government's volatile transitions is that its statements
 must address many different audiences and groups: toward FARC, the government
 must be a tough negotiator; for domestic critics, the government must appease
 hawks' concerns about specific provisions such as seats in the legislature
 for ex-guerrillas or amnesty from prosecution; for the military, the government
 must reassure them of their place in the conflict and about concerns regarding
 potential prosecution of military personnel for acts committed during the
 war; for the international community, the government must pledge its commitment
 to peace as it possibly seeks regional or United Nations assistance with
 the implementation of any deal; and for the public, the government must
 convince them that an agreement will actually bring about peace, that the
 voices of victims of the conflict have been heard, and that they should
 vote in favor of the agreement if it is on a referendum.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The House of Representatives passed a bill in 2013 requiring that any deal
 from Havana must survive a referendum, but this was followed by wrangling
 in the constitutional court and various statements by the president suggesting
 that a popular vote would happen if an agreement was made but that this
 was not legally required.[El Tiempo] 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, anecdotally we may consider some events in the peace timeline that
 are objectively likely to have affected whether the government was in a
 hardline or conciliatory state.
 In June 2015, FARC launched a series of attacks including attacking police
 stations and bombing infrastructure such as oil pipelines in Norte de Santander
, Putumayo, and Nariño, resulting in an oil spill that caused severe environment
al damage and contaminated the water supply of thousands; and bombing power
 stations that supplied electricity to the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco.
 [Guardian] [Colombia Peace Timeline] [Colombia Reports] This time period
 coincides with the high level of regime-switching observed in the government
 graph.
 Also interesting, however, is the lack of regime switching in November
 2014 following FARC's kidnapping of a general.
 The government suspended peace talks from November 16 and talks resumed
 on December 9

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although threatening to suspend or suspending talks (

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, with noisy and irregular data, matching events to states is imperfect
 and in any event assumes certain associations between events and sentiment
 measures (e.g.
 in the paragraph above, I assume that devastating FARC attacks are associated
 with more negative sentiment and a less conciliatory stance from the government
).
 More generally, although sentiment and regime changes may be very sensitive
 to events, the broader implication of this model is that neither side spends
 much time of the negotiations in the state of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness.
 Moreover, although skepticism has been a common response to FARC's claim
 that it is committed to negotiating (rather than the violent means the
 organization has avowed) and its apparent willingness to accede (in provisional
 topic-specific agreements) to terms that fall short of its Marxist ideology,
 this model shows that FARC in fact was usually moderately to highly willing
 to negotiate over this time period.
 This conclusion is borne out by the (out-of-sample) peace agreement reached
 just three months after documents were scraped for this project.
 Using sentiment as a rough metric of FARC's true level of engagement in
 the talks is a new measure for use in war and peace studies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These probabilities also provide insight into whether states are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and may shed light on the lasting impact of events such as violent attacks
 during negotiations.
 If a FARC attack prompts a government hardline response, is this state
 persistent over time? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Sentiment response results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the second part of this paper, I estimate the responsiveness of sentiment
 to sentiment, in the form of a Markov transition matrix.
 As discussed previously, the probabilities in this matrix are calculated
 using a multinomial logit with maximum likelihood estimation.
 I test four models: The first is a simple MNL of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Model (2) adds year indicators to control for year effects, because of
 potential associations between sentiment and time (e.g.
 one might argue that sentiment in later years should be higher than sentiment
 in earlier years because of the survival of the peace negotiations).
 Model (3) adds covariates for violence and public opinion to the base model,
 in the form of log transformed number of FARC actions recorded in that
 month and log transformed presidential approval ratings for that month.
 Model (4) includes both the year indicators and the violence and public
 opinion covariates.
 Thus, Model (1) is nested in all of the other models, and Models (2) and
 (3) are nested in Model (4).

As shown in the fit statistics at the bottom of the table, the AIC and the
 BIC identify different models as the best choice, models (4) and (2) respective
ly.
 However, the log likelihood value suggests that the reduced model, (1),
 is actually the best fit.
 In the interest of parsimony, the following analysis will utilize model
 (1).
 I also use pairwise likelihood ratio tests (see Appendix).

Does sentiment respond to sentiment? There is a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 probability that the response to a low-sentiment government statement will
 be a low-sentiment statement from FARC, versus a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.14$
\end_inset

 probability that the response will be a high-sentiment FARC statement.
 On the other hand, there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.17$
\end_inset

 probability that the response to a high-sentiment government statement
 is a high-sentiment FARC statement, compared with a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 probability that it will be a low-sentiment FARC statement.
 (Another government statement is most likely to follow a government statement,
 for either level of sentiment.) This result seems promising: FARC seems
 more likely to respond to government statements with high positive sentiment.
 The government, on the other hand, is equally likely 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.08)$
\end_inset

 to respond with either level of sentiment to a low-sentiment FARC statement.
 Interestingly, the government is more likely 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.32)$
\end_inset

 to respond with a low-sentiment statement to a high-sentiment FARC statement
 and less likely to respond with a high-sentiment statement 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.23)$

The transition matrix provides a new method for answering some other questions
 about negotiations.
 We might ask whether sentiment is persistent or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; and whether, for instance, a shock such as a terrorist attack might permanentl
y derail sentiment (and the peace process).
 Low government sentiment has a high probability 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.73)$
\end_inset

 of continuing in subsequent time periods, although it should be noted that
 this was also the most common state occurring in the data.
 High government sentiment is about as likely to persist 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.49)$
\end_inset

 than it is to be followed by any of the other states combined.
 FARC's persistence is lower, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0.33$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.40$
\end_inset

 for low and high sentiment, respectively, although this result may partly
 reflect the relatively fewer FARC statements in the dataset.
