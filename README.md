Sentiment analysis and Markov models in R, plus some multinomial logits in Stata

Here you will find analysis that made it into my M.A. paper, and a bunch of stuff that didn't:

- sentiment analysis of text-as-data using LIWC dictionaries in Spanish (Pennebaker et al.)
- Markov modelling of the responsiveness of textual sentiment
- Hidden Markov model estimation of parties' willingness to negotiate in peace talks
- Multinomial logit in Stata (NB: default MNL in R uses neural networks instead of maximum likelihood estimation)
- Principal Component Analysis of text-as-data
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo modelling of text-as-data using GLMM
- many iterations of ggplotted graphs
