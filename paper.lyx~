\begin_layout Abstract
As peace negotiations can stretch on for years and are often marred by continued
 violence, bluffing, or internal factionalization, how can we assess whether
 progress is being made or predict whether talks will yield an agreement?
 In the international relations literature, game theoretical and cross-country
 approaches have been used to make predictions, but with limited applicability.
 This paper uses sentiment analysis as a new method that can answer these
 questions.
 Using texts from the ongoing (2012-present) peace talks between the Colombian
 government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC),
 I use word usage ratios to reveal whether actors are in hardline or conciliator
y state.
 I also show that one actor's sentiment (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative

) responds to the other actor's sentiment.

This paper offers several original contributions: a new dataset of government
 and rebel/terrorist texts as well as jointly released statements, all issued
 during an ongoing conflict; and the use of new methods to measure the somewhat
 ineffable quality of the tenor of peace talks.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
The Colombian conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia / Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia) was founded in 1964 the aftermath of the ten-year period
 of civil war known as La Violencia.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The group refers to itself as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia--Ejérc
ito del Pueblo (People's Army), or FARC-EP.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Originally a Marxist insurgency, FARC sought to overthrow the government,
 and its base was communists and rural peasants.
 (CFR) FARC's tactics included murder, kidnappings for ransom and disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion.
 Notorious as the longest-running guerrilla insurgency in the Western Hemisphere
, the violence has claimed the lives of more than 200,000 civilians and
 displacing millions.
 (BBC News) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has also contributed to violence and instability
 during the same period and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, violence,
 extortion.
 (CFR) ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the
 government as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several
 years.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s and 1990s, FARC's activities began to tax cocaine producers
 but soon became involved in cocaine production itself.
 (Wilson) This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups such
 as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces
 of Colombia), which battled with FARC about control over drug trafficking.
 (Wilson) FARC, the paramilitary groups, and the government have all been
 accused of human rights abuses.
 In the last 20 years, FARC's involvement with cocaine trafficking has prompted
 action from the U.S.
 government, and it has caught international attention with kidnappings
 for ransom and assassinations of political and military figures.
 Less widely known abroad is FARC's use of landmines, which have resulted
 in thousands killed or maimed, and their kidnapping and forced conscription
 of child soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, resulting
 in significant reductions the strength of FARC as well as other armed groups.
 (CFR) FARC's willingness to negotiate is generally attributed in part to
 this crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, began in the fall of 2012 in
 Havana.
 The talks are limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 The talks have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos, who succeeded
 Uribe in 2010.
 Despite negotiating preliminary agreements for the agenda topics, which
 will be included in the final peace deal, Santos's approval ratings have
 plummeted over the years along with public optimism about the talks.
 A deal faces not just the skepticism of the public but also vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe, as well as members
 of the military, that initially disapproved of negotiating with FARC and
 oppose agreement provisions that, in their view, would give the former
 rebels political representation and amnesty instead of prosecution for
 crimes committed.

\begin_layout Standard
With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the peace negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Numerous Secretariat members are on their negotiating team, led by the
 rebel alias Ivan Marquez.
 Despite this high-ranking participation and the declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the kidnapping of rural policemen
 to the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and have created an additional website about the peace
 process, which features the individual blogs of negotiators.

This project examines texts from the peace process up until May 31, 2016;
 however, it should be noted that president Santos and Timochenko signed
 a bilateral ceasefire agreement on June 22, 2016, and announced that they
 had reached a final deal on August 24, 2016, which will subsequently be
 voted on in a popular referendum.

Sentiment analysis of extremist texts.

\begin_layout Standard
Relevant analysis of extremist texts (

\end_inset

 being any form of written statement) has emanated from James Pennebaker
 and coauthors in the field of psychology.
 With a focus on divining the emotional and psychological states of individuals,
 Pennebaker's research has found associations between frequency of usage
 of particular types of words and emotional, cognitive, and social attributes.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) In analysis of extremist texts from American Nazi
 and militant animal rights organizations, they found that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

third-person plural pronouns are the single best predictor of extremism...
 suggest[ing] that the group is defining itself to a large degree by the
 existence of an oppositional group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung) Consistent with that result, their study of texts
 issued by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri of al Qaeda found greater
 frequency in the use of third-person plural pronouns, as well as emotional
 words and first-person pronouns.
 The data in that study differs in several significant ways from the data
 in this paper: those texts were translated, were authored by specific individua
ls,

 and were originally oral rather than printed texts.
 Other analyses of extremist texts have tended to focus on large corpora
 of online postings, for instance the emotional affect of posts on extremist
 Internet forums (Abbasi and Chen), network analysis of the authors of extremist
 blogs, (Chau and Xu) and content analysis of extremist documents.
 (Smith et al) Text analysis of politicians, on the other hand, tends to
 have a different focus, but one study of speeches of a former Australian
 prime minister, John Howard, found varying levels of fear-mongering rhetoric.

Peace negotiation literature: predicting success of ongoing talks, existing
 measurement methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Colombian peace negotiations exemplify numerous questions posed in internati
onal relations and war and peace studies which, to date, have been answered
 with approaches that do not utilize texts produced from the peace process
 and do not attempt to measure the ineffable qualities like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

tenor of the talks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mood of the government/rebel group.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, impressions or assessments of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how the talks are going
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inevitably affect the views of the negotiants as well as the public, and
 it is not a stretch to suggest that decisions made during talks may be
 colored by assessments of questions such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how serious is the other party about peace?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how hard are they pushing for their demands?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer to the first question, whether the other party is serious about
 negotiations, is significant for two reasons.
 First, (for example), the government needs to know whether FARC is serious
 about a peace deal that certainly would not include the implementation
 of a Marxist economic-political system.
 Second, regardless of what the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is about FARC's seriousness, popular impressions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC is toying with the government and the government isn't driving a hard
 enough bargain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) can especially affect a government's negotiating behavior, demands, and
 its level of military operations, as it has to answer to political opponents
 and, eventually, the next cycle of elections.
 For instance, the government long refused to stop military operations against
 FARC, and FARC frequently used its unilateral ceasefires to call for a
 bilateral ceasefire.
 The government's decision has been seen as a safeguard thwarting a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long con
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being played by FARC--that is to say, continued military operations would
 prevent FARC from using the negotiations as a cover to buy time to increase
 their military strength.
 (NOREF) Negotiations, after all, may very well fall apart without producing
 an agreement, because of (1) an inability to agree on settlements or (2)
 changes in relative military strength that cause either side to change
 its mind about deciding the outcome of the conflict at the negotiating
 table rather than on the battlefield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this discussion suggests, an assessment about an actor's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seriousness about peace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may be based on the level and nature of ongoing violence.
 Kydd and Walter, for instance, offer a game theoretical explanation for
 why violence during peace negotiations can sometimes derail talks by revealing
 information about an actor's capacity or willingness to control extremist
 factions.
 (Kydd) A driving force behind this research and these questions is the
 inability for one negotiant to discern whether the other is sincere, bluffing
 (potentially intererested in an agreement but overstating their demands
 to get a better deal), or uninterested in peace and stalling (to allow
 military forces to regroup), based on their words alone.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FARC negotiations are a fascinating example of the relationship between
 violence and negotiations.
 From the beginning of the negotiations, FARC called for a bilateral ceasefire,
 which the government denied up until just weeks before the final peace
 deal was announced in August 2016.
 Prior to that, FARC declared numerous unilateral ceasefires, although given
 the number of violations recorded by monitoring groups, it is debatable
 whether all of them should be truly considered ceasefires.
 The kidnappings or killings of policemen and bombings in rural departments
 (provinces) did not derail talks.
 Talks were suspended only on two occasions: first, when a high-ranking
 general was kidnapped, and second, when FARC escalated a campaign of bombings
 of infrastructure such as power plants and oil pipelines, resulting in
 an oil spill that was the worst environmental disaster in Colombian history.
 Meanwhile, the government, under a steady hail of pressure from right-wing
 politicians, continued military operations; despite that, FARC did not
 walk away from the negotiating table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other research on negotiations and violence, Bueno de Mesquita argues
 that violence increases after government concessions because more extreme
 members are left in control of their organization after moderate members
 accept the concessions.
 (Bueno de Mesquita) The peace process with FARC, with fifty regional blocs
 but a unified central command that has remained in control throughout the
 peace talks, does not exemplify a government employing a divide-and-conquer
 strategy of the kind discussed by Bueno de Mesquita.

 All are in the original Spanish, thus avoiding the obvious pitfalls of
 inter-translator variance, loss of nuance through translation, etc.

 [(http://wp.presidencia.gov.co)] The same president, Santos, has been in office
 during the peace talks, conveniently obviating variance that might result
 from different administrations.
 Because the government issues statements on all manner of topics besides
 FARC, a simple keyword search was used as an initial screening method.
 The implementation of this search differed slightly for 2012-2015 and 2016
 because of differences in the structures of the current and archived presidenti

 Altogether, the preliminary government dataset consisted of 545 documents
 published between January 1, 2012, and June 1, 2016.
 However, additional human screening of the statements was necessary to
 remove statements that contained the keywords but were (a) not relevant
 to the peace talks or (b) not reasonably attributable to the Colombian
 government.

The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was developed by Pennebaker.
 [INSERT CITES] LIWC in English has been used to analyze texts written by
 individuals from terrorist organizations (and translated into English),
 e.g.
 transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) The LIWC methodology reflects Pennebaker et al.'s
 approach to text analysis, which is centered around 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

examin[ing] people's social and psychological states by analyzing their
 use of function and emotion words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung 453), the former being relatively neutral words such
 articles or pronouns rather than words that are content- or document-specific.
 Consequently, LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pronouns
\begin_inset Quotes erd

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

)--are counted, and their percentage of total words in the document is calculate
d.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated from the English-language LIWC and augmented
 with additional words (e.g.
 synonyms for included words in Spanish) by Ramírez-Esparza, Pennebaker,
 García, and Suriá Martínez.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LIWC measures are admittedly crude word counts, the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest, and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual people, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, they reveal insights into the nature of the documents under
 analysis.
 This paper focuses on the following categories: positive emotion, negative
 emotion, and third-person plural pronouns, which research from psychology
 has found to be used at higher rates by extremist groups.

Modelling hidden states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task in this paper is to use the relative frequencies
 of word categories to model latent states that represent whether an actor
 is hardline or conciliatory.
 (For the purposes of this discussion, I assume two possible discrete states.)
 In other words, given a sequence of FARC documents, we are interested in
 the random variable that represents whether FARC is in a hardline state
 or a conciliatory state--a hidden state, as negotiants may bluff to get
 better terms.
 This model focuses on one actor at a time; we will look at how sentiment
 responds to sentiment subsequently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hidden (or latent) Markov model (HMM) is a special case of a Markov
 process.
 At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is at a state that is hidden or unobservable; however, from
 each state we can observe emissions, or symbols.
 In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of sentiment
 measures (e.g.
 percent negative emotion words in FARC statements), e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$
\end_inset

.
 We are interested in the corresponding sequence of hidden states which
 generated the sequence of emissions: e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{H},S_{H},S_{C},S_{H}),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$

 Thus, the realization of state at

 captures all information about what occurred prior to

 I also assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state

\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state

 Additionally, the probability of an observed emission

 depends only on the state

This discussion has used a discrete state space with two possible states;
 however, it can be generalized to a larger number of states.
 Although in some cases substantive/theoretical grounds may define an appropriat
e number of latent states for a HMM, for the spectrum of

 Mathematically, the optimal number of states can be identified by the Bayesian
 information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
 values.

Modelling sentiment response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper also uses Markov chains to model the response
 of sentiment to sentiment.
 This is to say, if a FARC issues a statement with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, is it likely that the next statement is a government statement
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment? I estimate the probabilities in the Markov transition matrix
 for this process using a multinomial logit.

The irregularity of the data does present some challenges, as there are
 stretches in the time-ordered sequence of FARC and government texts where
 little alternation occurs.
 (For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F,F,F,G,G,G,G,F$
\end_inset

.) This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly twice
 as many statements from the government as from FARC and that both actors
 sometimes release multiple statements on the same day.
 I assume that each text responds to the document that immediately preceded
 it.
 Our interest goes beyond looking at how FARC responds to the government
 and vice versa: repetitive issuances such as a

To estimate overall sentiment of these texts, I created a new measure based
 on research showing that in normal usage, positive emotion words occur
 twice as frequently as negative emotion words (Pennebaker and Chung).
 I constructed an indicator for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, taking on the former value if the proportion of positive words
 is at least twice the proportion of negative words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Although crude, this indicator is less noisy than using raw LIWC measures.
 I constructed another categorical variable for sentiment-party, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

FARC/low,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
