\begin_layout Abstract
This paper considers factors during the peace process that may explain the
 success or failure of peace negotiations and ultimately peace agreements.
 The FARC-Colombia peace talks from 2012-2016, although marred by continued
 fighting, sought to end an intractable half-century-long conflict with
 a negotiated settlement.
 Using a new dataset of statements from the Colombian government, FARC (Fuerzas
 Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), and the joint peace negotiators,
 I employ sentiment analysis and hidden Markov models to estimate each actor's
 willingness to negotiate as a function of their textual sentiment.
 I find that estimates of FARC and government willingness to negotiate can
 predict the sentiment of jointly released statements.
 I also use a Markov process to estimate sentiment responsiveness.
 I show that actors are more likely to respond to each other's statements
 with the same level of sentiment.
 These results suggest that this method of measuring the progress of peace
 talks is a promising new tool for research on why talks are successful
 or derailed by violence and, ultimately, why peace is durable after certain
 conflicts but not others.

Introduction

Why do some peace negotiations succeed while others fall apart, and what
 accounts for the durability of peace after some conflicts but not others?
 Better understanding the puzzles behind successful conflict termination
 is of great academic and real-world importance.

Analysis of peace processes, such as in the Middle East, has tended to be

 Researchers have offered theories to explain the variable effect of violent

 and the relationship between government concessions and the level of terrorist

 Often these accounts are driven by or complicated by an information asymmetry
 about whether actors are sincere and by the disconnect between unitary
 negotiants (government, rebel) and the cacophony of factions that each
 contains, as internal contestation and excluded or disgruntled parties
 can spoil the peace process

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the peace process is a key to understanding how agreements
 are produced and why some of them are successful.
 Researchers have examined many features of the negotiations process, but
 to my knowledge there is no research that analyzes texts issued from peace
 negotiations other than the final agreement itself, nor has sentiment analysis
 previously been used to study peace processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fill this gap, this paper makes several original contributions.
 First, I collect a new dataset of texts from the Colombian government and
 FARC, in addition to joint statements issued by the peace negotiators,
 from an ongoing conflict/negotiation period (2012-2016).
 Using text analysis methods from psychology and natural language processing
 to measure the sentiment of documents, I use hidden Markov models to estimate
 the state of the peace talks in terms of each actor's willingness to negotiate.
 I also use sentiment analysis and Markov processes to model whether the
 sentiment of one actor's statement can predict the sentiment of a subsequent
 statement from another actor--e.g.
 whether FARC is more likely to respond to a positive government statement
 with a positive statement of its own rather than a negative one.
 These methods enable researchers to measure the progress of peace talks,
 whether our interest is in how the state of the peace process affects the
 level of violence, agreement provisions, or durability of peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although it is difficult to draw causal conclusions from observational data,
 texts from peace negotiations are a promising and heretofore unutilized
 source of information about the state of the peace process.
 A better understanding of these processes has valuable real-world implications:
 measuring the persistence of negative sentiment in fragile negotiations,
 for example, may help us explain the mechanisms through which extremist
 attacks derail peace talks.
 Moreover, understanding how sentiment responds to sentiment may yield insights
 about signalling and bluffing not only in peace negotiations but also in
 the exchanges between countries that avoid or lead down the path to war.

Background and literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) was founded in 1964, in the
 aftermath of the ten-year period of civil war known as La Violencia.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The group's rarely used, official name is Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
 de Colombia--Ejército del Pueblo (People's Army), or FARC-EP.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Originally a Marxist insurgency seeking to overthrow the government, FARC's
 supporters were mainly communists and rural peasants
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 FARC's current circumstances can be traced to the 1980s and 1990s, when
 it began to tax cocaine producers, soon becoming involved in cocaine production
 itself
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wilson-center"

\end_inset

.
 This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups, such as the
 Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia),
 who battled FARC about, inter alia, control over drug trafficking
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wilson-center"

\end_inset

.
 FARC's tactics have included murder, kidnappings for ransom, disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, and extortion; less widely known abroad
 is their use of landmines, which killed or maimed thousands, and their
 kidnapping and forced conscription of child soldiers.
 The right-wing paramilitaries used many of the same tactics as well; AUC
 was also labelled a terrorist organization and was also involved in drug
 trafficking prior to being disbanded in the mid-2000s

 FARC, the paramilitary groups, and the government have all been accused
 of human rights abuses in the violence, which has claimed the lives of
 more than 200,000 civilians and displaced millions

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has much the same history as FARC: it was founded
 around the same time and has also engaged in murder, kidnappings, extortion,
 and other violence

 ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the government

 During the '80s, FARC also co-founded a political party, the Patriotic
 Union, which had declined into nonexistence by the '90s after thousands
 of its members, politicians, and candidates were murdered

 FARC's willingness to negotiate, after more than fifty years of the longest-run
ning insurgency in the Western Hemisphere, is generally attributed in part
 to this crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, commenced in the fall of 2012
 in Havana and have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos.
 The talks were limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 Over the course of the peace process, negotiators came to preliminary agreement
s for these topics, which will be included in the final peace deal.
 Despite this, Santos's approval ratings have plummeted since he took office,
 because of public skepticism/pessimism about the talks and the vociferous
 opposition of right-wing politicians such as Uribe, as well as some members
 of the military, that oppose agreement provisions which, in their view,
 give the former rebels political representation and amnesty instead of
 prosecution for crimes committed

With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Their negotiating team, led by the rebel alias Ivan Marquez, is comprised
 of numerous Secretariat members and has included top members from key Fronts
 (regional subdivisions).
 Despite this high-ranking participation and FARC's declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the killings of rural policemen to
 the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and have created an additional website about the peace
 process, which features the individual blogs of negotiators.

Theory and hypotheses

\begin_layout Standard
Why does it matter how peace talks are going? First, I will discuss the
 answer to this question from a behavioral and bargaining point of view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impressions or assessments of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

how the talks are going
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 affect the views of the public, and decisions made by negotiants may be

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how serious is the other party about peace?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how hard are they pushing for their demands?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This paper offers new methods of measurement that get past the vagueness
 or relativism in the way these questions are stated.
 The answer to the first question, whether the other party is serious about
 negotiations, is significant for two reasons.
 To use FARC-Colombia as our example: The government wants to know, given
 the political cost of continuing to negotiate and the still heavier cost
 of a failure (during the long slog of peace talks a common observation
 was that Santos 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

has staked his legacy on the deal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

), whether an avowedly Marxist-Leninist group that has continued to launch
 attacks will actually follow through on a peace deal that will require
 disarmament/demobilization but almost certainly will not the implement
 of a Marxist economic-political system.
 Second, regardless of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about FARC's seriousness or what their demands are at the negotiating table,
 popular impressions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FARC is stalling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the government isn't driving a hard enough bargain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) affect the government's bargaining behavior and demands in public and
 in private, its level of military operations, and certainly its rhetoric.
 The government has to answer to public opinion, political opponents and,
 eventually, the next cycle of elections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, peace talks are often characterized by mistrust and an inability
 to know whether the other party's statements are sincere.
 For instance, Santos's government long refused to stop military operations
 against FARC, although FARC frequently used its unilateral ceasefires to
 call for a bilateral ceasefire.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, research by Bueno de Mesquita theorizes that violence increases
 after government concessions because more extreme members are left in control
 of their organization after moderate members accept the concessions in
 exchange for counterterrorism assistance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "demesquita-conciliation"

\end_inset

.
 The government held out on the bilateral ceasefire, arguably FARC's most
 coveted concession, until just weeks before the final deal was reached,
 but in any event FARC has displayed a unified central command rather than
 one vulnerable to fragmentation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The government's decision is seen as a safeguard thwarting a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

long con

 being played by FARC--that is to say, continued military operations would
 prevent FARC from using the negotiations to stall as they increase their
 military strength 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "battaglino-lodola"

\end_inset

.
 A variety of concerns likely contributed to the government's suspicions:
 first, the criticism of politicians such as Uribe; second, continuing FARC
 attacks; and third, the fact that negotiations could very well fall apart
 without producing an agreement for other reasons.
 Although this paper focuses only on the negotiation process leading up
 to a peace agreement, mistrust can extend to the implementation of a deal
 (e.g.
 FARC would be wary of disarming or giving up secret information such as
 its members' locations if it thought the government would renege).

Negotiations and violence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the above discussion suggests, current assessments of an actor's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seriousness about peace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 factor in the level and nature of ongoing violence.
 However, to date the analysis of peace negotiations has not utilized sentiment
 analysis.
 Instead, perhaps because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actions speak louder than words,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the focus of much empirical research is on violence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, Kydd and Walter offer a game theoretical explanation for why
 extremist violence during peace negotiations can sometimes derail talks
 by revealing information about the rebel group's capacity or willingness
 to control extremist factions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kydd-walter"

\end_inset

.
 The government cannot discern whether the rebels are sincere, bluffing
 (potentially interested in an agreement but overstating their demands to
 get a better deal), or uninterested in peace and stalling (to allow their
 forces to regroup), based on their words alone.
 Similar reasoning underlies one rationalist explanation for war, which
 is based on on the incentives of both parties to misrepresent their resolve
 to go to war and their military power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fearon"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the fact is that many negotiations take place without a bilateral ceasefire,
 as the FARC negotiations did.
 Although the talks were not derailed by either regular low-intensity violence
 or shocks, they were temporarily suspended on certain occasions.
 This suggests that we may want to examine the state of the negotiations
 over than time to understand how the effects of violence unfolded differently.
 I argue that the texts issued from negotiations can be used to model the
 state of the negotiations in terms of actors' willingness to negotiate.
 With better measurement and better understanding of the dynamics of how
 agreements are reached, we may be able to learn not only about how violence
 affects talks but also how talks affect violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another body of post-conflict research attempts to explain why war recurs
 or peace survives in different situations.
 One theoretical explanation is that most civil wars do not end with negotiated
 settlements because of bargaining failures and commitment problems: it's
 hard for people who have been killing each other to agree to stop 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "walter1997critical"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, such research argues, the key to peace survival is designing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

credible guarantees
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to convince combatants to commit to treaties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "walter2002committing"

\end_inset

.
 Other research on peace agreements has found that peace survival can be
 predicted by the circumstances of the just-ended conflict (e.g.
 its intensity and the nature of the previous regime), as well as provisions
 such as territorial autonomy and assurances of security made by third-party
 states or organizations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, such research analyzes peace agreements while overlooking the dynamic
 nature of negotiations and the other texts produced in the process.
 Much as we might look at the draft bills and amendments that precede a
 piece of final legislation, if we want to understand what contributes to
 durable peace, or why bargaining falls apart, we should be interested not
 only in the end result, but also in the process that generates agreements
 or fails to achieve them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper cannot answer all of the questions posed in the section above,
 but it does introduce new measurement techniques that can aid in those
 answers.
 I present a regime-switching Markov model that estimates an actor's willingness
 to negotiate using measures of negative and positive emotion.
 To validate the states that the model predicts, I predict there is a positive
 relationship between a predicted state of high willingness to negotiate
 and the sentiment and incidence of joint statements.
 When FARC and/or the government are predicted to be in a conciliatory rather
 than a hardline state, joint statements should be more likely to occur
 and their sentiment should be more positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of the paper, I model the responsiveness of sentiment
 using another Markov process.
 I hypothesize that an actor is more likely to respond with the same level
 of sentiment used by the other actor in the most recent statement.
 In other words, if FARC issues a statement with high (positive) sentiment,
 the following government statement is more likely to respond with high
 rather than low (negative) sentiment, and vice versa.

Data

 The data was collected from September 1, 2012, the month in which formal

 Unfortunately, this excludes the weeks leading up to the announcement of
 a final peace agreement in August 2016.

 FARC, or if the statement simply noted support for the peace process from
 international organizations or third-party countries), reducing the number

 It should be noted that the casualty figures include deaths from the smaller

 in Defense Ministry statistics that are disaggregated by rebel group (e.g.

 In the estimation, I use the log number of FARC actions because it is the

Sentiment measures

This paper uses the Spanish version of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
 (LIWC), which was first developed in English by Pennebaker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The LIWC methodology reflects Pennebaker et al.'s approach to text analysis:

the former being words such articles or pronouns that are relatively devoid
 of content 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pennebaker-chung"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pronouns
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the categories of

\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

optimism
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 as a percentage.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated and augmented (e.g.
 additional Spanish synonyms for words translated from the English) by Ramírez-E
sparza, Pennebaker, García, and Suriá Martínez

, as it turns out the government uses them more frequently than FARC on
 average, and they are highly correlated with both positive and negative
 emotion.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

These statistics are admittedly crude word counts; the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest; and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual authors, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, the LIWC sentiment measures can reveal insights into the
 nature of the documents, and testing LIWC's applicability to these kinds
 of texts is also valuable.
 Methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and traditional time-series
 analysis proved to be unsuitable, owing to the high variance in the length
 of documents and the highly irregular issuance of statements, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling hidden states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first estimation task is to use the shares of positive and negative
 sentiment in a sequence of texts to model a Markov regime-switching model,
 in which the hidden regimes are discrete states that represent the government
 or FARC's willingness to negotiate--that is, whether they are in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state.
 In other words, we are interested in the random variable that represents
 FARC's (or the government's) willingness to negotiate, which is directly
 unobservable.
 Instead, we observe the stream of positive and negative sentiment of the
 FARC documents, which emanate from the latent state that FARC is in at
 the time.
 (For the purposes of simplifying this discussion, I assume a state space
 with two possible states, but the model can theoretically be generalized
 to any number of states.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hidden Markov model (HMM) is a special case of a first-order Markov
 process.
 The sequence of states is a Markov chain: the probabilities of being in
 a hardline or conciliatory state, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

, respectively, exhibit the Markov property, namely that the probability
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the realization of the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the realization of state at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 captures all information about what occurred prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 I assume that the process is stationary, i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the process is in a hidden state and we observe the emissions, or symbols,
 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{t}$
\end_inset

 from time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of an observed emission 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jurafsky"

\end_inset

 Thus, we can compute the probability of a stream of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1},...O_{T}$
\end_inset

 by using a shortcut called the forward-backward algorithmn to sum over
 all of the hidden state sequences that could have generated that the stream
 of observations.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rabiner1989tutorial"

\end_inset

 In this case, the observed sequence of emissions is a stream of loessed
 sentiment measures: the percent of negative emotion words in FARC statements
 might look like 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.01,0.12,0.04,0.01)$
\end_inset

.
 We are interested in the corresponding sequence of hidden states which
 generated the sequence of emissions: for example 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{H},S_{H},S_{C},S_{H}).$
\end_inset

 We are also interested in the transition probabilities, which represent
 probability of moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}=S_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t+1}=S_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 These probabilities are represented in transition matrix

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discussion has used a discrete state space with two possible states;
 however, it can be generalized to a larger number of states.
 In some cases substantive/theoretical grounds may define an appropriate
 number of latent states for a HMM; however, because the spectrum from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can reasonably be split into different numbers of states, I adopt an agnostic
 approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimizing the number of states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best-fitting number of states for a HMM can be identified by the Bayesian
 information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
 values.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other applications of hidden Markov models, the number of states is not
 mathematically optimized because it and the labels attached to the states
 tend to determined by substantive criteria: e.g.
 in medical examples, values for various indicators of health that fall
 within certain ranges correspond to pre-set states, and in economic examples,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 markets are modelled with two states that clearly correspond with economic
 indicators.
 This paper uses a more agnostic approach.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To keep interpretation across the FARC and government models comparable,
 I specify the same number of latent states.
 The substantive interpretation of the model accommodates small numbers
 of latent states: for instance, two latent states would correspond to a
 dichotomy between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while three latent states might represent low, moderate, and high levels
 of willingness to negotiate, representing hardline, moderate and conciliatory
 regimes, respectively.
 As the number of states increases, the substantive interpretation of transition
 probabilities across these states becomes more challenging, and a higher
 number of states means that fitting the model becomes difficult because
 transitions between any two given states may be rare or nonexistent.
 I weigh these considerations against the models' log-likelihood, BIC, and
 AIC values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Labelling the states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because HMM estimation does not attach substantive labels to the states,
 such labelling must be done post-estimation.
 I explore two possible methods.
 First, I construct a ranking of the unlabelled states in order of relative
 willingness to negotiate using measures of central tendency.
 For example, the state with the highest mean positive emotion and lowest
 mean negative emotion would correspond to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conciliatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), while the state with the lowest mean positive emotion and the highest
 mean negative emotion should be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 I also use a multi-choice decision matrix to optimize the ranking of states
 based on the average sentiment measured in each unlabelled state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modelling sentiment response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this paper uses a Markov process to model the response
 of sentiment to sentiment.
 The irregularity of the data does present some challenges, as there are
 stretches in the time-ordered sequence of FARC and government texts where
 little alternation occurs.
 (For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F,F,F,G,G,G,G,F$
\end_inset

.) This is partly owing to the fact that the dataset includes roughly three
 times as many statements from the government as from FARC and that both
 actors sometimes release multiple statements on the same day.
 I assume that the sequence of time-ordered statements represents a single
 Markov process, like a back-and-forth debate in which each text responds
 to the document that immediately preceded it.
 This means that a FARC document could respond to a previous FARC document.
 Repetitive issuances, such as a series of low-sentiment documents, might
 indicate a strategy where actors make public denunciations to get better
 terms at the negotiating table, or they might be directed at another audience.
 For example, the government might issue several low-sentiment statements
 to show the political opposition or the public that it is being tough on
 FARC.
 Our main interest, however, is whether an actor's sentiment can predict
 the sentiment of other actor's next statement: for instance, if, following
 a FARC statement with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment, it is more likely that the following government statement is
 also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

low.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in normal usage, positive emotion words occur twice as frequently as negative

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

low

 words in a statement is at least twice the loessed proportion of negative

 I tested additional models that include covariates for the level of violence
 (log number of FARC actions recorded for the month) and public opinion
 (log monthly approval rating for Santos's decision to hold peace talks
 with guerrillas).

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing Model (1) vs.
 (2) and Model (3) vs.
 (4) shows that the inclusion of violence and public opinion covariates
 does little to improve fit.
 Going from 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2,$
\end_inset

 the improvement in BIC and AIC values demonstrates that a mixture is a
 better fit for the data than a single state.
 However, for the FARC models with and without covariates, the BIC values
 suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 optimizes the number of latent states; although 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 has a slightly better BIC value than 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 in both models, the improvement is marginal and is weighed against the
 consideration that the fewest possible number of latent states should be
 used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AIC values for the FARC models, however, as well as both the BIC and
 AIC values for the government models, favor a specification with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=5$
\end_inset

.
 However, these improvements in fit must be balanced against the tradeoff
 in the interpretability of results in a model with so many states (e.g.
 what is the substantive meaning of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transition from 1/5 to 2/5 hardline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?) and the difficulty of substantively labelling a large number of states.
 Consequently, the following analysis will proceed with a HMM with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 latent states, and without public opinion and violence covariates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Labelling the states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latent states represent high, moderate, and low willingness to negotiate.
 However, the HMM estimation does not attach substantive labels to numbered
 states, nor does it order the states by magnitude.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is readily apparent that with 
\begin_inset Formula $n>2$

 state 2 with

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

 willingness to negotiate, i.e.
 the conciliatory regime, while the state with the highest negative and

\begin_layout Standard
Across the board, the standard deviations relative to the means are high,
 due to the spread of the data and the fact that some states rarely occur.
 The mean and median agree on their predictions, and positive sentiment
 for FARC and negative sentiment for the government do produce the same
 rankings, but the rankings based on negative sentiment contradict each
 other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of these contradictions, I use a multi-choice decision matrix, implement
ed in the MCDM R package, to identify the optimal ranking based on different
 methods for computing multi-criteria decisions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "martin-mcdm"

\end_inset

.
 The ranking maximizes negative sentiment and minimizes positive sentiment:
 the state ranked first is low willingness and the state ranked third is
 high willingness.
 When using either the mean or median sentiment, the overall decision matrix
 maps states 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moderate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (conciliatory).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
HMM results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Markov transition matrices shown below represent the probabilities of
 regime switching for FARC and the government, estimated using the loessed
 negative and positive emotion measures and labeled according to the results
 of the decision matrix.
 First, looking at the diagonals, we find that when FARC is hardline (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness) or moderate, there is a high probability that it will continue
 to be hardline or moderate.
 For the government, on the other hand, the transition probabilities in
 each row are more evenly dispersed.
 These probabilities may shed light on the lasting impact of shocks such
 as violent attacks during negotiations; it appears that if a shock should
 put FARC in a hardline state, it may be hard to transition out of that
 state again, but the same is not true of the government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other interesting results are that FARC is predicted to never transition
 directly from low to high and vice versa, and to never transition from
 moderate to low: yet all of these transitions do occur, perhaps because
 of rounding, in the graphs below, which show the estimated states of FARC
 and the government over the time period of the negotiations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The government is most likely to transition to a state of moderate willingness
 from any state.
 However, when the government is in the state of moderate willingness, it
 is roughly equally likely to transition to a hardline or conciliatory state
 (
\begin_inset Formula $0.24$

 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $0.28$

\begin_layout Standard
Both FARC and the government spend little time in the moderate state, which
 suggests that a model with two latent states might actually have been preferabl
e for ease of interpretation.
 Overall, the government's willingness to negotiate is more volatile, with
 frequent regime switching from low to high throughout the time interval.
 The irregularity and frequency of data explains some of this volatility:
 statements may be issued days or months apart, and there are three times
 as many government documents.
 But although the higher frequency of government statements affects the
 appearance of the regime-switching graph, the government does have lower
 probabilities of state persistence, as seen in the diagonal of the transition
 matrix.
 The higher probabilities in FARC's transition matrix diagonal are consistent
 with the group's less volatile regime-switching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A potential explanation of the government's volatile transitions is that
 its statements must address many different audiences and groups: toward
 FARC, the government must be a tough negotiator; for domestic critics,
 the government must appease hawks' objections about specific provisions
 such as seats in the legislature for ex-guerrillas or amnesty from prosecution;
 for the military, the government must reassure them about concerns regarding
 potential prosecution of military personnel for acts committed during the
 war; for the international community, the government pledges its commitment
 to peace as it possibly seeks regional or United Nations assistance with
 the implementation of any deal; and for the public, the government must
 work against their skepticism, assure survivors that the voices of victims
 of the conflict have been heard, and convince people to vote yes in a referendu
m.
 FARC, on the other hand, addresses its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constituency,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rank and file fighters who need to be persuaded to demobilize; the government
 and occasionally the right wing (e.g.
 accusing Uribe of being a paramilitary); and sometimes the nation.
 There is less at stake for FARC should it fail to appease one of these
 audiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anecdotally, we may consider some events that are objectively likely to
 be associated with the government's willingness to negotiate.
 In June 2015, FARC launched a series of attacks, bombing infrastructure
 such as oil pipelines in Norte de Santander, Putumayo, and Nariño, resulting
 in an oil spill that caused severe environmental damage and contaminated
 the water supply of thousands; and bombing power stations that supplied
 electricity to the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "guardian-pipeline,colombiareports-attacks,colombiapeace-timelines,telesur-timeline"

\end_inset

.
 This time period coincides with an episode of frequent regime-switching
 observed in the government graph, but it coincides with a period of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate in the FARC model.
 Although bombings and conciliatory sentiment seem contradictory, the conciliato
ry sentiments in FARC's statements during this period may explain how the
 peace talks continued despite the attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The government's state of low willingness to negotiate in November 2014
 following FARC's kidnapping of a general seems consistent; the government
 suspended peace talks from November 16, and resumed them on December 9

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although threatening to suspend or suspending talks (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

) may seem like a common bluffing maneuver, the government carried out this
 threat very rarely during these negotiations: in fact, only on these two
 occasions.
 FARC suspended talks on one occasion in 2013, over objections about the
 government's plan to hold a referendum

 This episode, too, falls within FARC's long spell of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 willingness to negotiate, and again, the conciliatory sentiment of FARC
 (combined with the safe return of the general) may help explain why the
 peace talks recovered from this crisis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With noisy and irregular data, matching events to states is imperfect.
 To evaluate the validity of the hidden Markov model, I use a regression
 of joint statement sentiment on the predicted states of willingness on
 the day that the statement was issued, with linear interaction terms, to
 test the first hypothesis that willingness to negotiate is positively associate
d with positive sentiment of joint statements and negatively associated
 with negative sentiment.
 I also use a logistic regression to test the second hypothesis that there
 is a positive association between conciliatory states and the issuance
 of joint statements.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding hypothesis (1), the interaction terms show that when both FARC
 and the government are in the low willingness (hardline) state, this is
 associated with much lower levels of positive sentiment and slightly lower
 levels of negative sentiment, relative to the moderate willingness state.
 An even more pronounced effect is observed when FARC is in a conciliatory
 state but the government is in a hardline state, relative to the moderate
 willingness state.
 These results provide some support for the HMM estimations, although their
 statistical power is hampered by the small number of joint sentiment observatio
ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are also interested in whether willingness to negotiate is correlated
 with whether a joint statement is issued at all.
 Since joint statements can announce agreements on policy, progress reports,
 or the next steps in the negotiating schedule, their occurrence may be
 a metric for how much is being accomplished in the negotiations.
 To test whether the states estimated by the HMM can predict joint statement
 issuance, I created date/state indicator variables for FARC and the government
 for each day in the negotiations period, and a dummy variable for joint
 statement issuance.
 I use a logistic regression with linear interaction terms.
 However, none of the results are statistically significant, and the hypothesis
 does not find support.
 (Table in Appendix.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sentiment response results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the responsiveness of sentiment to sentiment, in the form of
 a Markov transition matrix.
 The probabilities in this matrix are calculated using a multinomial logit
 with maximum likelihood estimation.
 I test four models: The first is a simple MNL of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $State_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Model (2) adds year indicators to control for year effects, because of
 potential associations between sentiment and time (e.g.
 one might argue that sentiment in later years should be higher because
 of the survival of the peace negotiations).
 Model (3) adds covariates for violence and public opinion to the base model,
 in the form of log transformed number of FARC actions recorded in that
 month and log transformed presidential approval ratings for that month.
 Model (4) includes both the year indicators and the violence and public
 opinion covariates.
 Thus, Model (1) is nested in each of the other models, and Models (2) and
 (3) are nested in Model (4), the full model.

\begin_layout Standard
I use pairwise likelihood ratio tests to compare each nested model with
 the full model.
 Those results suggest that Model (4), with year effects and the log violence
 and log public opinion coefficients, is the best fit, so the rest of the
 results proceed using that model.
 Model (4) is also the best according to its AIC value; however, the BIC
 and the log likelihood values identify models (2) and (1), respectively.
 Per the likelihood ratio test results, I proceed with the full model, (4).
 (A full table of all four models' results is included for reference; however,
 we are interested in the transition probabilities rather than the coefficients
 in the table.)

The graph below shows the predicted probability of each state.
 Relative to the beginning of the peace process, high government sentiment
 is much more likely and low FARC sentiment much less likely, although high
 FARC sentiment remains fairly flat throughout.

Summary of findings

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is a first attempt at applying text and sentiment analysis methods
 to the study of conflict negotiation.
 So far research on negotiations processes has often focused on the effect
 of violence, while research that does look at texts tends to focus on peace
 agreements.
 This paper models the process that produces those agreements.
 Measuring the ongoing state of a negotiation process can contribute to
 research on the peace process spoilers and on the relationships between
 negotiations, agreement provisions, and peace survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the results in this paper suggest, using sentiment analysis to measure
 actors' willingness to negotiate is a promising frontier.
 My choice of a three-state hidden Markov model was guided by considerations
 of model fit as well as interpretability, but the results actually suggest
 that a dichotomy of hardline/conciliatory may be preferable.
 Surprising, too, were the findings that a sentiment-only model was as good
 of a fit as a model that included covariates for levels of public opinion
 and violence.
 Future HMM estimation could thus be considerably simpler than it was in
 this paper.
 With that said, substantive labelling of latent states is essentially a
 classification problem that could be resolved using machine learning techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transition probabilities of the HMMs indicate a high level of state
 persistence for FARC and a more even distribution of probabilities for
 the government.
 Although this may at first seem counterintuitive, I suggest some theoretical
 reasons that the government's regime-switching is more frequent and volatile
 than FARC's, namely that the government's statements must address numerous
 political and public audiences.
 Although it does not offer a causal explanation, the regime-switching model
 also suggests a potential theory for how the peace process may have survived
 two crises--FARC's kidnapping of a general and FARC's bombing campaign
 of infrastructure--because of positive sentiment in FARC's statements during
 these periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In validating the HMM results, I found that higher FARC/government willingness
 to negotiate is not necessarily correlated with more positive sentiment
 in joint statements, and that the two actors appear to have differential
 effects on joint sentiment.
 I was unable to find support for the hypothesis that joint statement sentiment
 is correlated with FARC and government willingness to negotiate.
 The relationship between individual negotiants' output and documents from
 negotiations, final or otherwise, deserves further scrutiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sentiment response model supports the hypothesis that one actor's sentiment
 can predict the other actor's sentiment in a subsequent statement and that
 actors mirror each other's sentiment.
 Surprisingly, FARC was generally more likely to respond positively and
 the government was generally more likely to respond negatively, and government
 negativity was more likely to persist.
 These trends of persistence and volatility, as well as the reasoning behind
 repetitive issuances of statements, might be illuminated by a game theoretical
 model of bargaining that incorporates these statements as signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other research building on this paper might consider measuring sentiment
 in ways other than LIWC.
 Using a general dictionary, and using very general categories such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have the advantages of being extendable to other conflicts or to non-conflict
 applications.
 However, a dictionary with political science-specific terms, or even conflict-s
pecific terms (e.g.
 terms that might refer to a specific leaders, locations, events, etc.) may
 be the way forward for more refined analysis and more specific results.
 Building custom dictionaries requires extensive background knowledge and
 time; however, as dictionaries such as LIWC are not available in all languages,
 custom dictionaries may be necessary for comparative research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between sentiment and the level of violence is of obvious
 importance.
 With disaggregated violence statistics, further research may be able to
 unearth the relationships between specific kinds of violence (e.g.
 bombings, murders, etc.) and trends in sentiment, and reveal insights about
 peace process spoilers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Particular to this case study, the data can be updated to include statements
 leading up to the August 2016 peace agreement announcement or the referendum.
 Given that provisions of a peace agreement can predict whether peace will
 survive, much can be learned from studying the process that produces these
 agreements.
 Examining the relationship between the sentiment of texts from the peace
 process and the final agreement may enable us to predict peace survival
 from negotiations sentiment.
 Another interesting area of future inquiry is the Colombian government's
 imminent negotiations with the ELN, which could be a step toward extending
 these results to other conflicts and contexts.

Estimation: A note on fitting hidden Markov models using depmixS4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expectation-maximization algorithm used in fitting hidden Markov models
 to data, implemented in the depmixS4 R package, randomly generates start
 values by generating random uniform values for the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}(j)=P(S_{t}=j|O_{1:T},z_{1:T},\theta')$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are the observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1:T}$
\end_inset

 are covariates, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

 is the set of initial model parameters.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "depmixs4"

\end_inset

 Even when the seed is set to a fixed value, the EM algorithm does not always
 produce the same results because it randomly assigns the initial state,
 meaning that it does not generate the same transition matrix every single
 time.
 It does, however, reliably generate a limited number of transition matrices:
 three different matrices for FARC, and four for the government.
 (The rows of these matrices may be arranged in different orders, but they
 are equivalent because substantive labelling of the states i.e.
 rows occurs subsequently.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matrices usually had identical values, but in a few cases differed by 0.001,
 or rarely by 0.01, because of rounding during fitting.) I fitted the model
 1,000 times for FARC and the government separately, and used the most frequentl
y occurring models (the selected FARC model occurred 596/1000 times, while
 the government model occurred 916/1000).
