\begin_layout Abstract
Will peace negotiations fall apart or yield an agreement and, ultimately,
 peace? The international relations literature has employed game theoretical
 and empirical approaches to make these predictions.
 However, there currently does not exist any research that uses sentiment
 analysis of texts issued during peace talks to make inferences.
 What are the associations between these texts associations and levels of
 ongoing violence or milestones reached in negotiations? In the context
 of the peace negotiations between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas
 Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), I seek to answer the following
 questions: How does government

The conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colombia's conflict with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC;
 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [also known as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucio
narias de Colombia--Ejército del Pueblo, or FARC-EP]) began in the aftermath
 of the ten-year period of civil war known as La Violencia.
 Originally founded in 1964 as a Marxist insurgency, FARC sought to overthrow
 the government, and its base was communists and rural peasants.
 (CFR) FARC's violence included kidnappings for ransom and disappearances
 of civilians and security personnel, extortion, and murder.
 Now notorious as the longest-running and only remaining guerrilla insurgency
 in the Western Hemisphere, the violence has claimed the lives of more than
 200,000 civilians and displacing millions.
 (BBC News) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s and 1990s, FARC's activities expanded to include the drug trade,
 beginning with taxation of cocaine producers but eventually cocaine production
 itself.
 (Wilson) This sparked the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups such
 as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC; United Self-Defense Forces
 of Colombia), whose bloody battles with FARC were often about control over
 drug trafficking.
 (Wilson) FARC and the paramilitary groups, as well as the government, are
 accused of human rights abuses.
 In the last 20 years, FARC's involvement with cocaine trafficking has prompted
 action from the U.S.
 government, and it has caught international attention with kidnappings
 for ransom and assassinations of political and military figures.
 Less notorious was the use of landmines, which have resulted in thousands
 killed or maimed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN; National Liberation Army), a smaller
 and also Marxist group, has also been active in the same period, also engaging
 in kidnappings for ransom, violence, and drug trafficking.
 (CFR) ELN began pursuing cooperation with FARC and peace talks with the
 government as FARC's peace process came underway over the last several
 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Peace process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the tenure of president (now senator) Álvaro Uribe from 2002-2010,
 the government cracked down on Marxist groups and drug traffickers, resulting
 in significant reductions the strength of FARC as well as other armed groups.
 (CFR) FARC's willingness to negotiate is attributed in part to this crackdown.
 Peace talks, brokered by Cuba and Norway, began in the fall of 2012 in
 Havana.
 The talks were limited to an agenda of six topics: agrarian reform/land
 development; political participation; ending of the conflict (i.e.
 ceasefire, post-conflict justice, disarmament, and reintegration); illegal
 drugs; victims; and implementation.
 The talks have been championed by president Juan Manuel Santos, who succeeded
 Uribe in 2010 and was re-elected in 2014 during the peace negotiations.
 As the talks have dragged on, Santos's approval ratings have plummeted
 along with public optimism about the talks, and he has faced the vociferous
 opposition of Uribe and other hardline politicians as well as members of
 the military that disapprove of negotiating with FARC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With many of its leaders and founders killed in the years leading up to
 the peace negotiations, FARC is currently led by a rebel known as Timochenko.
 Numerous Secretariat members are on their negotiating team, led by the
 rebel alias Ivan Marquez.
 Despite this high-ranking participation and the declaration of several
 unilateral ceasefires during the negotiations period, attacks have continued
 during the peace talks, ranging from the kidnapping of rural policemen
 to the kidnapping of a high-ranking general and the bombing of oil pipelines.
 Throughout (and prior to) the talks, FARC has released public statements
 on their website and maintain an active Internet presence--their website
 even features the blogs of peace negotiators.

Sentiment analysis of extremist texts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relevant analysis of extremist texts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

text
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being any form of written statement) has emanated from James Pennebaker
 and coauthors in the field of psychology.
 With a focus on divining the emotional and psychological states of individuals,
 Pennebaker's research has found associations between frequency of usage
 of particular types of words and emotional, cognitive, and social attributes.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) In analysis of extremist texts from American Nazi
 and militant animal rights organizations, they found that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

third-person plural pronouns [e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] are the single best predictor of extremism...
 suggest[ing] that the group is defining itself to a large degree by the
 existence of an oppositional group.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) Consistent with that result, their study of texts
 issued by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri of al Qaeda found greater
 frequency in the use of third-person plural pronouns, as well as emotional
 words and first-person pronouns.
 The data in that study differs in several significant ways from the data
 in this paper: the texts have been translated, are authored by specific
 individuals, and were originally oral, not written, texts.
 Other analysis of extremist texts has tended to focus on large corpora
 of online postings: the emotional affect of postings on extremist Internet
 forums (Abbasi and Chen), network analysis of the authors of extremist
 blogs (Chau and Xu), and content analysis of extremist documents.
 (Smith et al).
 On the other side, analysis of texts from a former Australian prime minister,
 John Howard, found fear-mongering rhetoric.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of this paper's contributions is an original dataset comprising communiques
 and statements from each of FARC and the Colombian government, and joint
 communiques issued by the peace negotiators in Havana.
 All documents are in the original Spanish, thus avoiding the obvious pitfalls
 of inter-translator variance, loss of nuance through translation, etc.
 The time period of interest is September 2012 through May 2016, an interval
 bounded by the announcement of formal peace talks and by the beginning
 of this project.
 (FARC and the government agreed on a bilateral ceasefire in June 2016,
 outside of this time period.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The documents were web-scraped with Python from the following sources: First,
 every communique from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Comunicados
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section of the official FARC website (http://farc-ep.co/comunicado.html)
 was scraped, for a total of 119, of which ### fell between 9/2012 and 5/2016.
 Some communiques were authored by specific FARC generals, but this analysis
 does not examine individual-level authorship.
 A small number of non-topical communiques were removed from the dataset:
 for example, a statement on May 30, 2016, announced the death (from heart
 attack) of a high-ranking FARC official who had been participating in the
 peace talks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, every joint communique from the official Mesa de Conversaciones
 (negotiating table) website was scraped (https://www.mesadeconversaciones.com.co/d
ocumentos/comunicados-conjuntos), for a total of 71 documents.
 I excluded joint reports (of which fewer than ten exist) issued from the
 peace talks because their purpose, format, length, and audience differed
 from the other public statements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, statements from the Colombian government were scraped from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sala de Prensa
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Press Room) section of the Colombian president's website (http://wp.presidencia.
gov.co).
 Conveniently, the same president, Santos, has been in office during the
 peace talks, removing variance we might expect to see between different
 administrations.
 Because the Colombian government issues statements on all manner of topics
 besides FARC, some human screening of the statements was necessary.
 Press releases from 2012-15 were scraped if the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Farc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the typical capitalization used in the Spanish, with the exception of
 FARC's own publications, which usually refer to the organization as FARC-EP)
 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (peace) were in the text of the document.
 Documents from 2016 were scraped from a new website of the Colombian president
 (http://es.presidencia.gov.co/noticia); they were included in the preliminary
 dataset if they were returned as results of a search for the terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

farc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 using the website's search tool.
 Altogether, the preliminary government dataset consisted of 545 documents
 published between January 1, 2012, and June 1, 2016, but it still included
 statements that were (a) not relevant to the peace talks or (b) not authored
 by the Colombian government.
 For example, one statement from May 27, 2013, was titled

 (

).
 The author manually scanned through each document and removed ones that
 were irrelevant (e.g.
 if the peace talks with FARC were mentioned in passing), leaving ### documents
 in the dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Violence data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to a timeline of major events (e.g.
 significant kidnappings or attacks), monthly statistics for the level of
 violence were gathered from several sources.
 The number of service personnel killed per month was taken from

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

offensive actions
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of FARC per month were collected from the statistics made available by
 two Colombian peace analysis groups.
 For 2012-2014, the source of the data was Fundación Paz y Reconciliación
 (PARES).
 For 2015-2016, the data came from Centro de Recursos para el Análisis de
 Conflictos (CERAC).

Sentiment analysis.
 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was developed by Pennebaker.
 LIWC in English has been used to analyze texts written by individuals from
 terrorist organizations (and translated into English), e.g.
 transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
 (Pennebaker and Chung) The LIWC methodology reflects Pennebaker et al.'s
 approach to text analysis, which is centered around 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

examin[ing] people's social and psychological states by analyzing their
 use of function and emotion words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Pennebaker and Chung 453), the former being relatively neutral words such
 articles or pronouns.
 Consequently, LIWC measures are very simple: words belonging to specific
 categories--parts of speech (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

articles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pronouns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that are the aforementioned function words, or types of emotion (within
 the categories of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there are subcategories such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anxiety or fear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)--are counted, and their percentage of total words in the document is calculate
d.
 The Spanish LIWC was translated from the English-language LIWC and augmented
 with additional words (e.g.
 synonyms for included words in Spanish) by Ramírez-Esparza, Pennebaker,
 García, and Suriá Martínez.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LIWC measures are admittedly crude word counts, the categories of words
 are not tailored for political science purposes or for the conflict of
 interest, and the dictionaries are intended for the analysis of personality
 traits of individual people, not organizations.
 Nevertheless, they reveal insights into the nature of the documents under
 analysis.
 This paper focuses on the following categories: positive emotion, negative
 emotion, death, and third-person plural pronouns, which research from psycholog
y has found to be used at higher rates by extremist groups.
 (Pennebaker and Chung)

\begin_layout Standard
Modelling hidden states.
 The hidden (or latent) Markov model (HMM) is a special case of the Markov
 process.
 In this model, the discrete state at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is unobservable, but its emissions, or symbols, can be observed.
 A transition matrix, consisting of transition probabilities of moving from
 one state to another, is based on the probability of observing a symbol
 during a given state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of latent states is determined by substantive/theoretical grounds
 and confirmed by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike
 information criterion (AIC).
 For this analysis, each actor (i.e., FARC or the government) can be in one
 of two hidden states: hardline or willing to make concessions.
 The observed symbols are measures of sentiment from documents.
 This particular HMM focuses on one actor over time.
 This, with 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 being the hardline and concessions states, respectively, the transition
 matrix takes on the form

\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{HH}$
\end_inset

 is the probability of moving from a hardline state to a hardline state,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{HC}$
\end_inset

 is the probability of moving from a hardline to a concessions state, and
 so on.
 These probabilities will provide insight into whether states are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: for example, if a FARC attack prompts a government hardline response,
 is this state persistent over time? I assume that the process is stationary,
 i.e.
 the probability of moving from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 does not depend on how long the process has been in state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate these transition probabilities,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modelling sentiment response.
 To model the manner in which one actor's sentiment may respond to the other
 actor's sentiment (e.g.
 FARC issues a dire statement, and the government responds in kind with
 an equally dire response), I assume that a document responds to the most
 recent document that preceded it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimation methods.
 To estimate the Markov transition probabilities, I use a multinomial logit
 model with random effects.
 This also requires a substantial flattening of sentiment measures into
 a very crude, single indicator of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment.
 Previous research has shown that in normal usage, positive emotion words
 occur twice as frequently as negative emotion words (Pennebaker and Chung),
 therefore I created an indicator based on this measure: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentiment if the proportion of positive words is at least twice the proportion
 of negative words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 otherwise.
